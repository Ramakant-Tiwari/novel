Helmut was aware of this but didn’t really pay it any mind. Was there a reason to?

‘After all, I have no rivals in the second year.’

Helmut felt no alarm at the word ‘if.’ An ‘if’ had to be significant enough to matter.

The gap between him and the second-ranking, Asuka, was enormous. If the other second-year students were crawling on the ground, he was flying in the sky.

He had learned to fly freely, casting off shackles, a sensation impossible for those bound to the earth.

It was as improbable as an infant defeating a knight.

‘Even if I were to catch a cold and run a high fever, the outcome would be the same.’

Thus, he could afford to be relaxed about the upcoming comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Even if he had won the martial arts tournament among the elite Palma Knights of Basor, how could a student competition hold any concern for him? He was not arrogant to think so.

Alea agreed with him.

“If it’s you, winning is a given. They’re about to announce the location of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, but think of it as a leisurely trip. The prize money isn’t insignificant either.”

Helmut, however, had been distracted by other matters lately.

Of course, being distracted didn’t mean he neglected his duties. He maintained his training schedule and was diligent during classes.

It was only outside these times that a change had occurred, specifically concerning Alea.

The two would run into each other every morning or afternoon in the hallway, separated by a single door.

As if they could naturally walk into each other’s rooms if someone happened to show up, they would briefly chat. Fortunately, this didn’t happen often, so they could leisurely converse.

Although Asuka and Sian could be nuisances, this was a secluded end corridor.

One day, as the preliminaries drew near, Alea clasped something onto Helmut’s wrist.

It was a bracelet with finely engraved silver patterns.

It was neither thick nor heavy, but as with most ornaments, it felt somewhat cumbersome. Now he had another one to wear.

“What’s this?”

“A bracelet. Since you seemed to wear the one I gave you before quite well, consider this a reward.”

Helmut stared at her intensely for a moment. Was it an illusion to feel like he was wearing two dog collars?

He had never used the first bracelet she had given him to summon her.

This too was a magical bracelet. He could feel a faint magical aura enveloping it.

“What function does this have?”

Alea casually mentioned.

“Well, I’ve been doing some research on ‘that’.”

‘That’ would likely be the seed of darkness. Helmut felt as if he had become a subject of observation for Alea, much like Sian’s spirit.



H.F.C Chapter 201 (Part 2):

`				`Being a mage, Alea couldn’t possibly remain indifferent to the existence of a human with a seed of darkness she had never encountered before.

Alea had a different kind of interest in Helmut, though separate from affection.

‘If it’s interest, then so be it.’

Alea had no intention of using him as a test subject, but she occasionally poked and prodded at him, casting unknown, harmless spells.

While it was a strange feeling to be the subject of curiosity, Helmut let her be.

It seemed she had achieved some results in her research.

“So you need to hide ‘that’, right? But if someone is particularly perceptive, they might notice under certain conditions, like those white ones.”

She spoke cryptically, but it was understandable.

‘The white ones’ referred to the temple. The second high priest they met, Pascal, had been slower to react than the first, Dolos. Helmut suspected Pascal had not immediately noticed the dark seed within him.

But sensitivity varied among the high priests.

A more perceptive high priest might immediately sense the dark energy within the seed of darkness.

“It’s because of the temple’s permission that the academy of Baden could participate in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament. If they attend, who knows if they might observe something. That’s why I thought about what we could do.”

Despite knowing of Pascal’s disappearance, the temple had not made a fuss or pursued the matter aggressively.

Alea, who often met with the dean, was aware of this.

Nonetheless, it was difficult to believe that they held no suspicions about the academy in Baden.

The timing was too coincidental. Just visiting Baden and then encountering them on their way elsewhere!

‘What’s done is done.’

Alea thought that Helmut must not get caught up in anything during the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament if the priests were watching.

The solution wasn’t simple. First and foremost, he should not manifest vis in its usual form. The dark energy carried by Helmut’s ashen Vis was unavoidable.

‘The trace of dark energy that seeps out when using Vis…’

Alea decided to approach the problem from a different angle.

“This bracelet creates a thin barrier around it to block the outburst of dark energy. Think of it as a derivative of my artifact. It won’t be as effective as the magic of my artifact, which overlays illusions, but it’s more natural since it’s mixed with cleansing magic, making it harder to detect.”

A modest amount of artifact use was permitted in combat, whether in a swordsmanship contest or a martial arts tournament. It wasn’t simply a matter of fighting bare-handed.

Participants could bring better weapons and wear better armor, as long as it wasn’t excessive.

“Thank you.”

Helmut grasped Alea’s hand eagerly. Alea smiled slightly.

“That doesn’t look like a thankful expression.”

Helmut’s expressions were almost always unreadable. This time was no different.

“Is that so?”

After a moment’s thought, Helmut reached out and pulled Alea into a tight embrace. Alea complied quietly.

Her hair rustled softly, and her body was frailer than it appeared, a natural consequence of her magic.

His heart thumped pleasantly. Dark emotions like malice, despair, and murderous intent fed the seed of darkness. What about such feelings then?

Helmut wondered.

One thing was certain: lately, the seed of darkness had not grown. It was quiet. He formed a hypothesis.

‘Could the thumping of my heart and its warmth enhance my control over the seed of darkness?’

Whether or not the hypothesis was correct, even if nurturing the seed of darkness, Helmut did not want to push Alea away.

If there had been any progress in their relationship, it was that their contact had become more natural. Alea, still disguised, was highly cautious of her surroundings, so timing was crucial.

“You inspire me. I’ve never before studied how to use magic for someone else. But look, I’ve made not one, but two bracelets for you.”

Alea spoke as if delighted.

‘Sounds like affection for a test subject.’

That was just the way of a mage.

Lifting her head while nestled in his arms, Alea’s eyes sparkled like stars.

“This weekend, there’s a place I’d like us to visit.”

“Alright.”

Asuka had suggested something, but it hardly mattered.

Helmut maintained a balance, spending half of his weekends with his friends, Asuka and Sian.

He sometimes visited the Kudrow Mansion with Alea, but not always.

Helmut actually wanted to lose that balance. But there was still much time ahead, and Alea was exceedingly careful.

‘Dating you might get us caught off-guard at any moment. One must always be vigilant about how things could turn out.’

Being caught in a romantic relationship might be better than being suspected of an inappropriate relationship between male students.

That could place their guardians, the dean and the instructor, in difficult positions.

The dean knew the truth, but Ethan Kudrow would be shocked to know Alea was a girl.

For that reason, Helmut was extra vigilant about their surroundings when with Alea.

“Remember the place we went for the last assignment?”

“Ah, yes.”

Lampione’s dungeon. Helmut didn’t say it aloud, but Alea nodded.

“It looks like it’s safe to enter now. I’ve been stabilizing it bit by bit each holiday. It was a complete mess, but it’s been cleaned up now. You had a stake in it too, didn’t you?”

“Is there treasure?”

“I don’t know. We’ll find out when we go in.”



H.F.C Chapter 202 (Part 1):

`				`The dungeon was a culmination of all that Lampione had amassed throughout his life.

It held not only his magical legacy but also his vast wealth.

In fact, it was his wealth that drew other mages to seek out his dungeon.

‘A dungeon would be a place undisturbed by anyone else.’

Helmut felt drawn to that idea. He and Alea were too conspicuous, making it hard to avoid attention. In comparison, this place seemed safer.

It seemed rumors had spread about them wandering the streets during their assignment period.

The dormitory rooms were suitable places too, but the problem was Alea’s reputation for being prickly and exclusive in personality.

No matter how close they were, it looked odd to others for Alea to always have Helmut in her room, and vice versa.

‘This is difficult.’

Had he ever expected to agonize over finding a suitable date spot?

While he couldn’t stop Asuka and Sian from complaining about his exclusive time with Alea, at least the issue of location was resolved.

“Isn’t it dangerous? Maybe. But there might be some stubborn ones there.”

Alea shrugged lightly.

They had taken control of the space, but Lampione’s golems remained inside the dungeon. Whether they would readily accept a new master was uncertain.

Helmut somewhat regarded this as cleaning up after their last dungeon venture.

‘This exploration might not be peaceful.’

Since the direction also allowed for sword training, it didn’t really matter to him.

Helmut nodded.

“Alright.”

Sian had been harboring suspicions lately. He considered himself quicker and wittier than others, a sentiment Asuka couldn’t deny.

‘There’s something odd about those two.’

Helmut and Alea had grown noticeably closer recently.

They were often seen whispering together, as if plotting something.

Most of all, their eyes changed when they looked at each other. That subtle current between them.

‘Something must have happened during the assignment.’

He knew there was an understanding between them that others weren’t privy to. They had known each other even before enrolling at the academy.

Both Helmut and Alea were reserved about their personal lives.

Many had tried to dig into Alea’s past due to her fame, but none had succeeded.

A suspicion grew within Sian.

“Could it be Alea…? No, that’s ridiculous.”

“What is?”

His oblivious friend Asuka asked curiously. Sian dismissed it with a smile.

‘Yeah, how could that be possible here at Greta Academy?’

Someday, he would be able to confirm his suspicions. There was no need to rush.

\*

When the weekend finally arrived, Helmut and Alea promptly headed to the dungeon in the forest near Baden.

After teleporting to a secluded location, Alea drew a dense and intricate magic circle on the ground.

“I’m summoning the dungeon entrance here. You can access specific areas by embedding markers or creating permanent entrances, but I’ve cut off all entrances so no one can get in. This is the only way in.”

“Can anyone summon it if they know how to draw the circle?”

Helmut watched the magic circle with interest.

He could memorize its form without missing a detail. He could redraw it anytime.

A magic circle operates by being infused with magical power. So, if one draws the circle and infuses it with power, the entrance should open, right?

However, Alea shook her head.

“I told you this dungeon is bound to me. So, the magic’s properties must also match.”

Before entering the dungeon, Alea spoke softly to Helmut.

“I have a favor to ask.”

As Helmut looked at her silently, Alea quickly stated her request.

“Whatever happens inside, please try to avoid damaging anything? While dungeon damage can be repaired, the items inside, like the furniture attached to a house, cannot. Each item is a product of Lampione’s research.”

It was now Alea’s property. Though it might resist her slightly as if reluctant to become her property, she had to restrain it without destroying it.

Lampione’s sophisticated golems were as much a product of high magic as Heike’s artifacts.

Alea smiled, excited about re-entering the dungeon.

‘I’ll take good care of your legacy, Lampione.’

Whether Lampione had tried to take her body or not, Alea bore no ill will towards him.

She knew there could be challenges. Now that she had the dungeon, her expectations were high. She planned to make good use of it.

“Be careful.”

Helmut nodded. It sounded like he was being told to fight with restrictions, but it would be interesting.



H.F.C Chapter 202 (Part 2):

`				`This was a real test. After fighting with full force against the temple, he had progressed in his achievements.

Fighting under intense pressure and guarding against sacred magic, Helmut had exhausted his physical and mental strength, which had advanced his skills.

Battles that risked one’s life were good ways to improve one’s skills.

“I’m opening the door now.”

As soon as Alea declared it, she infused the magic circle with power.

A bright light traced an oval line over the glowing magic circle.

It was a door large enough for one person to enter. Through it, a glimpse of the dungeon’s scenery could be seen – the place that had nearly become their grave.

Alea stepped through first. Her body passed through the passage with the light. Helmut followed closely behind.

Moments later, they were fully inside the dungeon. The door closed behind them.

Helmut looked around and spoke.

“It looks different from last time?”

“I reconstructed it, in my own style.”

Alea shrugged. Unlike the previous dungeon, which had been a series of empty rooms, the interior was now decorated like a noble’s mansion.

Luxurious green wallpaper with prominent golden patterns caught the eye. A fireplace with crackling flames for some reason.

Antique furniture and the layout of the interior gave it a cozy, charming mansion feel.

“I designed it thinking of my workshop. Lampione’s space had some unique magic that almost perfectly realized whatever I envisioned. I don’t need to buy anything specific; I just need to think concretely.”

“You must feel like a god here, being able to shape space at will.”

“Not quite. Shaping space takes a lot of magic, and creating something from nothing even more so. The dungeon is fundamentally made of magic. Manifesting non-material into material is godlike in the real world, and even in a dungeon, it’s incredibly difficult.”

Her tone wasn’t boastful. She wasn’t bragging.

But her words implied something significant: that it was possible because Alea was that skilled a mage, a mage on her way to becoming an archmage.

Most mages couldn’t even dream of becoming an archmage.

While swordsmanship required talent, magic had an absolute boundary that couldn’t be reached by effort alone.

Exceptional intellect, the talent to handle magic, and the right environment—all were necessary.

Helmut had recognized Alea’s power as a powerful mage the moment he first saw her. That’s why he had not made her an enemy.

They had become close under the guise of tutoring. There was no calculation in it. But perhaps it was instinct?

However, what was certain was that dating Alea was not due to any event or confrontation.

If Alea became an enemy, Helmut would suffer a fatal blow. He had never exposed such a vulnerability to anyone before.

“Could you create a training ground for me?”

Helmut asked abruptly. Alea laughed.

“Planning to come often, huh? A training ground.”

“It would be better than a cafe. You could read, and I could train instead of reading.”

A hint of dissatisfaction could be felt in Helmut’s words.

Alea placed her hands on her hips, lecturing in a strict manner that was quite endearing.

“Reading nourishes the mind. Books are treasure troves of knowledge. I thought you had developed a liking for reading?”

It seemed it was planned. Even when they shared a room, Alea had retained her tutor-like demeanor, always checking if Helmut was studying diligently.

She often recommended books that would be helpful for his classes.

Regardless, Helmut diligently read the books she suggested. It wasn’t enjoyable at all.

“Mystery novels are fun, but they’re pointless.”

Helmut was a pragmatist. The mentality of securing victory in the most efficient way was something he learned from Darien.

Having lived through harsh routines in the Forest of Roots, he found enjoyable books a waste of time that didn’t really help.

“I want to train.”

“But you are strong.”

“My enemies are strong too.”

Helmut answered firmly. He had dealt with two high priests.

Doesn’t that mean he no longer needs to fear the temple? Helmut thought.

But the knights he had faced were not the temple’s elite forces, just a group escorting a high priest to Baden.

Moreover, the enemy hadn’t known his identity. Helmut had fought in the forest, a battlefield favorable for fighting many with few. All these factors had aided him.

Alea, too, had thwarted a potentially fatal strike against him.

If the high priest had succeeded in casting purification magic, Helmut would have been at least incapacitated.

‘If they had known my identity, they wouldn’t have fought that way.’

He had never faced a prepared temple. The temple’s knights were said to be as powerful as the Palma Knights.

Someday, Helmut would have to prepare for when his identity is revealed. It wasn’t time to be complacent with just this level of achievement.

‘Alea isn’t letting her guard down about possibly being discovered as a woman in disguise at the academy either.’

It was similar to that. It wasn’t the time to be comfortable with the current situation. Alea seemed to understand this as she nodded.

“I’ll consider the training ground. The space needs to be large enough, and it must withstand Vis. If possible, I’ll make it conducive to Vis training.”

Alea pondered for a moment, then asked.

“Shall I let you open the entrance? Hmm? No, that might be risky. Maybe when I’m present. There are still many parts of this dungeon I don’t fully understand.”

Alea slowly walked towards the fireplace.

As she placed her hand on a spot, the fireplace naturally slid to one side.

Grrr! A secret passage quickly formed behind the fireplace. It was a mystical hidden passage.

Though somewhat unnecessary within an inaccessible dungeon, it seemed to suit Alea’s tastes.

Alea gestured to Helmut.

“Let’s go.”



H.F.C Chapter 203 (Part 1):

`				`The only space materialized according to Alea’s will was the first one alone. From there on, empty rooms unfolded.

Spaces that felt desolate like ruins, partially collapsed.

Alea had mentioned that even constructing the entrance consumed a great deal of magical power.

Helmut tilted his head.

“This dungeon, isn’t it quite large?”

“Right, so it will take time to refine the whole thing. It’s going to be a big project.”

“Is my training ground feasible, then?”

“If it’s just about creating a stable, wide open space, we can work it out here. It should be fine for training with Vis. However, in terms of efficiency, it might not match the academy’s training grounds. Building your official training ground will be a new challenge.”

“How will you cover the magic power needed?”

Lampione did not construct this dungeon overnight.

Even though ascending to the level of an Archmage smooths out the flow of magical power, this dungeon wasn’t made in a day.

‘It would take the combined magical power of all the students in Greta Academy’s magic department to bring it to its proper form.’

Helmut felt the same. Just as a good home requires a lot of work, so does a dungeon.

“Lampione’s dungeon had a revolutionary structure that was incredibly efficient in terms of magical power consumption. This dungeon itself is a creation of Lampione. I don’t know the method, so it took time even to construct the entrance, but I’m researching it. It will take some time, but it’s worth researching.”

Alea spoke with a face full of motivation.

Lately, Alea had been especially vibrant. As soon as she entered the dungeon, she stripped away her magic and returned to her original form. It was a welcome change for Helmut.

Alea looked like a girl rather than the cold, haughty second-year top student of Greta Academy’s magic department.

Helmut didn’t place high odds that it was because of him. He was still unsure about that part.

“But as I mentioned before, there are things to do first.”

Alea pointed ahead with the tip of her finger. Magical energy could be felt from all directions.

What looked like random stones placed far ahead. Upon closer inspection, they were golems.

They seemed familiar. The ones Helmut had slashed were now inexplicably intact and lying dormant, cores shattered yet still alive, which was surprising.

“The cores implanted in them don’t lose life force until completely shattered. If time passes while rooted in the dungeon, they automatically restore themselves. They’re as tenacious as weeds. That’s why the golems remain closer to their original forms too.”

Lampione’s golems had attack capabilities and physical recovery similar to magical beasts. Moreover, they absolutely obeyed their master.

Although their intelligence is unclear, they were formidable forces in themselves. Helmut realized:

“They would be useful militarily.”

Perhaps the culmination of Lampione’s lifelong research. If Lampione had a bit more time, he might well have created an army.

It doesn’t suit a mage’s nature, but if he had, he might have conquered the world.

“If this were known, every nation would have coveted Lampione’s legacy.”

“Fortunately, it remained unknown. As you know, I was the first to discover Lampione’s dungeon. And mass-producing these golems would be difficult. The materials are very expensive, and each requires a lot of work.”

“For research like that, it would have drawn attention. Why didn’t it become known?”

“Lampione thoroughly hid his golem research. He didn’t want his magical achievements being used for destruction or war. In that sense, he was close to being unambitious. He was just a scholar.”

His first and last malevolent decision was to take over a successor’s body.

Even that, due to his unfamiliarity with malevolent acts, was inadequately executed and ended in a resounding failure.

Nevertheless, Lampione’s honor would be preserved. Fortunately, those who could divulge the fact had secured his legacy.

Helmut stepped towards the cluster of golems. They were originally arranged in each room, but now they were simply scattered around the open field.

Apparently, Lampione had a taste for the grotesque, as their forms were oddly unappealing, Some had a strange shape like centipedes.

“Can their form be changed?”

“Yeah, but before that we should disable them in combat first to examine them. Just don’t smash them too harshly.”

From what she was saying, dealing with the golems seemed entirely Helmut’s responsibility. Just enough to shatter them.

As Helmut approached, the golems’ eyes lit up one by one with an automatic attack command.

Helmut drew his sword from his waist. A thin veil of gray Vis appeared over the blade. The golems were too solid to be cut without it.

‘Finally, some real action.’

There was no need for Alea to fight alongside him. The golems were threatening enough for ordinary people.

They possessed power no less than actual demonic beasts, and their metallic or stone skin was harder than a beast’s. Having faced them once before, he was fully familiar with their patterns.

‘I need to aim for the core to disable their functions. I just have to do it like last time.’

It seemed possible to recover as long as the core wasn’t completely split in half.

Whack! The golem sprung from the ground and charged at him like a missile. This time, there were no limits or constraints.

Helmut extended his Vis-charged sword and effortlessly shattered the golem. Crunch! Crack! Pieces fell to the ground in a heap.

In less than 20 minutes, Helmut could defeat every golem he visually confirmed.



H.F.C Chapter 203 (Part 2):

`				`Only after confirming their immobility did Alea approach. With a curious gaze, she examined the shattered golems.

From the magic power she was raising, it seemed she was changing their allegiances. Helmut asked:

“If they’re rooted in the dungeon, why don’t they obey you as the dungeon’s master?”

“These ones were made to be operated outside the dungeon. They’re individual existences separate from the dungeon. I have to change the allegiance of each one.”

Alea added admiringly as she examined the golem,

“I knew Lampione was a genius, but I didn’t realize he had done so much research on golems. It’s impressive. If I had lived in his era… I might have felt inferior to him.”

Helmut thought differently.

“Lampione might have felt inferior to you.”

“You think so?”

As Alea walked towards the golems, she changed the subject.

“You too. Listening to your story, my own challenging life seemed peaceful by comparison. You’re the first human to have left the Forest of Roots. I couldn’t have done what you did. I probably would have died the moment I entered the forest.”

“Luck played a part.”

“Luck… you mean them?”

“Yes, my master and Elaga.”

It felt awkward to refer to Elaga as a parent.

Helmut had human parents, and Elaga had not taken him in and raised him as a parent would.

It was more about securing food than nurturing or raising him.

Elaga was just Elaga.

If Helmut missed anything, it was likely Elaga’s warm body and soft fur.

It was exceptionally comforting to cling to that in cold weather.

Alea opened her mouth with a serene expression.

“…When you have time, won’t you tell me more about them? How you grew up in the Forest of Roots, what life was like there. We can talk about that here.”

Somehow, Alea had not broached the subject of the Forest of Roots before.

Choosing the right place for such topics was important, as they were not to be mentioned casually.

They were both curious about each other’s stories.

And it seemed Helmut had more stories to tell, given the many incidents in his life.

Helmut nodded.

“First, let’s check the legacy, then slowly.”

From afar, at the edge of the clearing, a small hole appeared. Just large enough for one person to bend down and step through.

It was blocked by a golem, almost like a gatekeeper, which is why it had gone unnoticed.

“Alright.”

Alea readily agreed.

The hole didn’t lead directly to a treasure vault. Inside was an intricately tangled maze.

The paths branched off complexly, some sloped or narrow. Sometimes they circled back to the original spot.

There was no particular danger, but the two wandered the dungeon for a long time. Helmut had to pull Alea back from the sloped paths several times.

Alea explained as if to make excuses.

“The different parts of this akspace have become jumbled and chaotic. I still can’t control this aspect of it.”

“Does this lead all the way to Lampione’s legacy?”

“Yes, when I took over the dungeon, my strongest desire was to connect the path to Lampione’s legacy.”

Magic is the power to realize will and desire. The dungeon had made a path.

Just that it was not easy, perhaps reflecting even the former owner’s will.

But soon, they reached the end.

“Over here. There’s a door.”

Emerging from the narrow cave path, a massive door appeared before them.

The entrance was adorned with intricate magical patterns, clearly no ordinary door. There was no handle.

Perhaps it could be pushed open from the side or inside. Without much thought, Helmut reached out to try opening the door.

At that moment, crackle! A spark flew. Helmut raised his Vis to block the current and raised an eyebrow.

“I guess you’ll have to do it?”

“There’s a defensive spell placed on it. Lampione must have layered numerous spells here. This must be the place.”

Alea clapped, and as soon as her hand touched it instead of Helmut’s, the door opened.

Alea quickly stepped inside. The musty smell of old books wafted out.

A vast library with shelves filled to the ceiling appeared before them. The scale was such that it required a ladder to reach the books, about ten times a person’s height.

Excitement flickered in the eyes of Alea, a bookworm, at the overwhelming sight.

“Lampione’s library. As expected, Lampione built this as the most secure place in the dungeon. It’s preserved in near-perfect condition with minimal damage. Look at those ancient tomes! There are rarer books here than most academies have. Almost half are magic books. There are so many I haven’t read!”

However, musty books were not important to Helmut.

He looked at the library crammed full of books like it was an obstruction he wanted to burn down.

“So where exactly is the treasure hidden?”

That was what mattered to Helmut. It was well concealed.

“It’s somewhere inside… There must be a path leading on. Mages connect libraries with their laboratories and storerooms.”

But at first glance, the inside of the library seemed to stretch endlessly with only bookshelves. An enclosed space filled solely with books.

Alea scanned the bookshelves and noticed one book with an unusually shiny spine.

“This must be one of Lampione’s works. Maybe this is it.”

The moment she pressed on the book’s spine, a change occurred.



H.F.C Chapter 204 (Part 1):

`				`It was an astonishing treasure trove, as if they had discovered the legendary treasure island. Helmut raised his gaze upwards.

‘I’ve heard mages are wealthy, but…’

This was far beyond mere wealth. Would even an emperor of an empire possess such a treasure vault?

Lampione may have been richer than the king of an entire nation.

Helmut, who had remained composed even when receiving Darien’s inheritance, was awestruck.

But truly, it was a sight to make one’s eyes go wide. Alea’s eyes had also grown large, undoubtedly feeling similar.

A mountain of gold coins piled nearly to the ceiling. If it collapsed, it could easily bury someone.

Unlike the neatly organized library, the gold and jewels were haphazardly stacked without care.

The most precious gems were set aside, with rudimentary preservation magic cast upon them, but they did not seem to be properly managed.

Nevertheless, the treasures, untouched by the passing of time, sparkled brightly enough to dazzle the eyes.

Except for matters related to magic, Lampione seemed to have no interest whatsoever, as this scene clearly demonstrated.

Alea murmured,

“It’s incredible. He hoarded nearly as much as Heike.”

Helmut flinched. That meant even Alea’s mentor had this much wealth. Alea would inherit it, although it wasn’t hers yet.

Helmut estimated his own share,

“Even half of this would be immense.”

“You can take more. But moving it all at once would attract attention.”

“Let’s just take what we need for now.”

Alea would not simply take the money for herself.

For her, like Lampione, wealth was a means to an end—a means to acquire materials for magical experiments.

For a highly skilled mage, it was only a matter of time before they could amass fortunes.

Helmut decided to fill the subspace pocket from the clothes he took from Talon with as many gold coins and gems as he could for now. It was an extravagant reward compared to his past labors.

‘Dungeon exploration is far more efficient than mercenary work.’

All it took was smashing a few golems, an easy task. So easy that if there were other archmages’ dungeons, he would want to raid them again.

But such things wouldn’t be ownerless. A mage of that caliber would have disciples to inherit his legacy.

Alea also took some gold coins.

“This should buy many mana stones. It’ll be a great help in restructuring the dungeon. And it might speed up the construction of your training ground. But where are the grimoires?”

Alea wasn’t concerned about that. Leaving Helmut behind, she walked deeper into the treasure vault.

With her keen eye, she spotted a small symbol carved on the wall beyond the mountain of gold.

“Over here.”

When she imbued it with magic, the wall slid open, creating an entrance. Alea stepped inside.

It was another subspace, similar to a library but empty.

Except for a few grimoires placed high on a pedestal at the center.

The area around it was enveloped in layers of strong magic—preservation and protection spells far more robust than those outside.

It was clear what Lampione valued more.

‘Can’t approach it without dispelling the magic first.’

Alea spent some time successfully undoing Lampione’s spells.

The delay was partly because she was excited. How long had she waited for this day?

‘Almost there.’

Soon, Alea’s hand touched one of Lampione’s grimoires. The magic essence Lampione had left behind recorded in a thick, large leather book.

Joy shimmered in Alea’s eyes. Helmut silently watched her rapidly reading through the grimoire.

The moment a wish is fulfilled, one feels reborn.

Just like when Helmut first stepped out of the Forest of Roots into the human world.

Soon, Alea turned around to share her joy, her face blossoming with a smile.

She was radiant as if glowing. It was the first time he had seen her so happy.

“We did it! Look at this.”

“Yes.”

Helmut nodded. He felt satisfaction from Alea’s reaction.

Not I, but we. The divide that had separated them was gradually dissolving into one.

That bond gave Helmut a sense of belonging he had never experienced before.

The change in his relationship with Alea made him feel many things.

Emotions he had never experienced before. As if he had entered a new world.

‘This must be a good thing.’

Even if he needed to steady himself from becoming too relaxed. Holding Alea’s hand had been the right choice. Helmut felt it anew.

After an hour, both were ready to leave the dungeon. Alea put her bracelet back on.

“Shall we go?”

They had obtained everything they aimed for. They would likely visit this place on holidays.

They left the dungeon feeling satisfied. However, something was secretly following them.

It was a small and faint presence, not enough to be considered a threat. It moved stealthily in the darkness.

The darkness was its domain, and it could follow them without being noticed if it wished. It was confident in that.

But the moment Alea opened the dungeon exit, the entrance was flooded with light.



H.F.C Chapter 204 (Part 2):

`				`The creature quickly threw itself into the light. If it didn’t follow quickly, even it might get trapped in the dungeon.

While entering the dungeon had allowed it to blend in with the dungeon’s energy, making its presence undetectable, it was a different story when exiting.

“What’s that? There’s something there!”

Alea turned around, and Helmut swung his sword toward the creature that had followed them out.

The creature, shocked, darted into the shadow of a tree. It tried to move along the shadow but was quickly bound by a powerful spell. It was a spatial lock.

Peeking out from the tree shadow, the creature appeared as an indistinct mass enveloped in black mist.

Approaching with his sword drawn, Helmut frowned. He immediately recognized what it was.

“This is…..”

“A spirit of darkness? One that lived in the dungeon? Or perhaps…”

If Lampione’s collection didn’t include a spirit, then its master must only be the person they knew.

Then, a scream-like shout came from afar.

“Woah! Stop! It’s my spirit!”

A silhouette suddenly burst out, yelling like a scream with a flustered expression.

“Sian…?”

The atmosphere froze. Sian quickly approached and pulled the spirit of darkness out from the tree’s shadow.

After securing his spirit, Sian scratched the back of his head, an awkward smile spreading across his face.

Helmut asked coldly,

“Why are you here?”

“Haha! That could happen. Why are you looking at me like I’m something to eat? You two have been sticking together so much lately, I was curious about what you do on weekends.”

He conveniently left out that he had been watching them out of suspicion. Luckily, his suspicions were unfounded.

‘They’ve been doing that together!’

They had been having such fun together, how could they be so sneaky?

He had been watching through the dark spirit but regretted not being able to join them.

The looks from Helmut and Alea were cold.

What had he found out? What did he know? They had to make him spill it all.

There were secrets Sian could know and secrets he mustn’t know.

They might have to silence him by any means necessary if needed.

Alea whispered to Helmut,

“Spirit mages share the spirit’s sight and thoughts, so memories can’t be erased.”

Killing to silence him was the only way. Sian, sharing senses with the spirit, heard those words too.

“Hey, Alea! What do you mean by erasing memories, that’s so sinister! Hey, Helmut! Why are you nodding? You’d do that to a friend? How did you two pass the academy’s ethics exams!”

“Ethics exams are just exams in the end.”

Alea cut in coldly. If Helmut was conflicted about what to do, Alea was ruthless.

They had to manage Sian somehow. While Helmut could go as far as murder, Alea was more hesitant.

They weren’t too close, but Sian was a fellow student at the academy. Killing him was a hesitant option for her, and Helmut likely felt the same.

‘So he’s curious enough to follow us this far, pretty bold.’

Tracking through a spirit was hard to detect. That’s why spirit mages were treated specially, but he had gone too far this time.

Helmut rested his hand on his sword. His jet black eyes exuded pressure by just looking, but exuded more threat when he revealed killing intent.

“Tell me what you’ve found out.”

There were things Sian could know and couldn’t. The paled Sian confessed readily.

“Alea inherited Lampione’s legacy? I heard the professors talking about it. Recently, Lampione’s dungeon was raided, and someone inherited the archmage’s legacy. I didn’t know it was you, Alea.”

Sian shrugged.

“I just found out today. Let me say though, I couldn’t see much. The connection gets hazy entering that subspace. Sharing sight with my spirit was blurred and vague. This one just watched from afar. All I know is the inside seems like a dungeon with lots of shiny stuff?”

“Is that true?”

Helmut asked. Not really addressing Sian. Alea nodded.

“Yes, when spaces separate, the binding weakens too.”

Alea had been experimenting with Sian’s spirit for the first semester. Mainly experiments about spirits and spirit mages. To find out the limits of their abilities.

Sian, as if surrendering, raised his hands.

“Hey hey, don’t do that! I keep secrets. I’ll keep my mouth shut, so don’t worry. Just meet one condition of mine. I can even take a mage’s oath here!”

“Swear first. We’ll hear the condition afterward.”

Helmut laid down a ruthlessly unfair condition.

Sian was quick on the uptake. Though pouting, he realized he had to comply in this situation, so he obediently recited the mage’s oath to keep Lampione’s inherited legacy secret.

His condition was this. Grinning, Sian said,

“Let me come check out the inside next time. It’s the dungeon of an archmage after all. It’d be great if you shared the inheritance too, but I don’t think you will.”

Sian was also a mage. He couldn’t help being curious about Lampione’s dungeon.

“I’ll consider it. You’d better watch your mouth. You wouldn’t want to be the first experimented on by Lampione’s magic.”

Alea threw a deadly warning. Sian shrugged.

“Got it.”



H.F.C Chapter 205 (Part 1):

`				`Although they had been discovered by a troublesome person, there was a silver lining.

Thanks to Sian, both of them gained a heightened sense of vigilance. Just as Sian had secretly followed them, someone else might do the same.

Helmut and Alea had to acknowledge that the people around them were more capable than they had thought.

No matter how well they hid, there were those who could infiltrate in unexpected ways.

Fortunately, Sian only knew that Alea had obtained Lampione’s dungeon; he was unaware of any other facts, not even that Alea was a girl.

The weak vision shared by the dark spirit made it difficult to notice the subtle changes in Alea.

At fifteen, Alea did not yet exhibit distinctly feminine features.

Helmut was left feeling uneasy.

‘For now, it’s been overlooked.’

Sian was quick-witted. Upon entering the dungeon, he immediately realized that Alea had acquired Lampione’s legacy.

Given a few more clues, he might uncover even more. His imagination was indeed rich.

Helmut and Alea still had many secrets. That Alea was a girl. That Helmut was Darien’s disciple. That Helmut possessed the Seed of Darkness, and more.

Given the situation, it wasn’t as if Helmut felt a great friendship towards Sian to share everything.

Telling the truth to Alea alone was more than enough.

‘I need to be more careful.’

The oath of a mage is inescapable, even for a spirit mage.

There was no reason for Sian to risk a penalty and divulge anything about Lampione’s dungeon.

He was someone who cherished himself immensely.

Helmut, just in case, cautioned Sian to keep their secret. Thus, their secret for two became a secret for three, excluding one.

Luckily, Sian completely dispelled any suspicions that Alea was a girl.

It was a prejudice. The cold and rigid Alea could never be a girl, he thought.

‘I might look more feminine in disguise than Alea.’

Realizing the secret, Sian nodded to himself.

‘So they’ve been huddled together over this. No wonder they’re always stuck together.’

Having breached Lampione’s dungeon, there must have been much to talk about.

Though Sian thought it would have been helpful if they included him and Asuka, he had to admit there was no reason to share Lampione’s legacy with them.

He wasn’t resentful, just regretful.

Most of all, the problem was Asuka, not himself. Sian couldn’t trust Asuka’s mouth either.

There had been no chance to test whether Asuka was tight-lipped, and that guy was mindless.

If someone were to interrogate him, he would spill everything easily.

‘Well, Asuka doesn’t have anyone to tell anyway.’

At most, he would tell his mother. Asuka had his secrets too.

Sian reconsidered his assessment of Asuka. Strangely, Asuka was tight-lipped about such matters.

No matter how much Sian tried to coax him or get him drunk to extract information, Asuka wouldn’t budge an inch.

All he learned was that Asuka seemed to have a bad relationship with his father.

‘Still, there can’t be a heavier secret than Lampione’s dungeon.’

He eventually decided to give up uncovering the truth for now, thinking he would find out someday.

Anyway, he firmly resolved to sneak into the dungeon and see it for himself. Sneaking in was his forte.

Thus, the dungeon of the two showed an ominous sign from the start.

As the holidays passed, the dungeon gradually took shape. Alea, who had stocked up on mana stones, immediately started working on it.

An antique tea room reflecting Alea’s tastes appeared, and a marble dining table was set. Various rare teas adorned a display cabinet.

Then Alea’s personal library was established. Separate from the grand library, it was a cozy space designed for concentration.

Helmut had to admit that his training ground was being pushed into the background more and more.

Though Alea said it was necessary to create a training ground, it seemed like the next steps were already planned.

Alea advised him.

“You know, you have the qualifiers coming up soon.”

It was as if she was asking if he had time to worry about the dungeon.

“The qualifiers, right.”

Helmut answered nonchalantly. Now that he thought about it, it was a significant event, but his attention had been completely absorbed by the dungeon.

Or was it just the dungeon? Time flew by when he was with Alea.

‘Maybe I’ve been practicing Darien’s swordsmanship too much lately, I should practice the common swordsmanship techniques too.’

Given the public nature of the tournament, appearing naturally skilled required some proficiency.

Helmut decided to head to the training ground as soon as the holiday was over.

In fact, unless there was something special like a mercenary request, he trained every day without fail.

‘I did beat up that golem, but that’s not enough.’

He had only swung his sword briefly while dealing with the golem. It wasn’t much of a warm-up.

That golem, since there wasn’t much opportunity for actual combat here, seemed like it could be useful.

However, it took time for the golem to recover.

Although Alea could heal it or use mana stones to speed up its recovery, it wasn’t something she could always do.

‘The tournament location will be announced soon.’

It was a trip. Traveling always meant something tumultuous for Helmut. Almost always, some incident occurred.

‘It couldn’t possibly be in Basor.’

If the location turned out to be there, he might have to forfeit. Even though he was in disguise, his presence was too well-known in the martial arts community.

But lately, with the complex political situation in Basol, the possibility of it being chosen was low.

Besides, the Basol people were rough, and there wasn’t even a decent swordsmanship academy there.

‘A trip to a new place.’



H.F.C Chapter 205 (Part 2):

`				`The human world was vast, and for Helmut, who had been confined in the Forest of Roots, every destination was always new.

The word “travel” sometimes made him feel truly alive.

Early in the morning, Helmut encountered two people in front of the dormitory.

These two were Asuka and Sian, excluding Alea. He had only briefly greeted Alea.

Normally, they would have met early and talked at length, but Alea had stayed up late absorbed in modifying the dungeon and had woken up late.

“Hey, Helmut, aren’t you going out too much? The qualifiers are coming up soon.”

Asuka crossed his arms and asked. He sniffed something suspicious, the so-called smell of secrets.

Helmut, Alea, and even Sian began to sense the subtle shifts among them.

“Are you guys up to something without me?”

Sian calmly shook his head.

“No, why would we be? More importantly, how’s your preparation for the qualifiers? Are you confident?”

“Confident? Of course… I am.”

His voice trailed off to barely a whisper. Asuka glanced at Helmut.

Lately, Asuka had been particularly immersed in training, but Helmut seemed more relaxed.

Seeing him gallivanting around during the holiday, one would think so.

But to him, Helmut felt like a massive mountain. A person could crumble.

Could such a giant mountain like Helmut really be toppled?

‘Whether it works or not, I have to try.’

Asuka gritted his teeth. Indeed, he was not one to give up. That was one aspect Helmut admired about him: his tenacity.

Thus, Asuka’s mind was completely focused on the qualifiers.

Sian quickly succeeded in changing the topic and added the news he had learned.

“They’re announcing the location of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament on the bulletin board at noon today. Aren’t you excited to find out where it will be?”

Asuka asked, his voice teasing.

“And you’re not even from the swordsmanship department, where do you pick up such news?”

“I just happened to run into Instructor Ethan Kudrow on the street and asked him.”

Having visited Kudrow Mansion several times with Helmut, Sian had become quite friendly with Instructor Ethan.

His naturally sociable personality made it easy to build a rapport with the stern and dignified Ethan.

Of all Helmut’s friends, Sian was the most normal and the easiest for Ethan to get along with.

Helmut felt relieved to have such a friend.

Asuka, of course, but Ethan too seemed a bit wary of Alea.

Alea had a certain princess-like quality, making it difficult for others to feel comfortable around her.

“He said to make sure you prepare well for the qualifiers and to visit Kudrow Mansion next weekend.”

Helmut had not visited Kudrow Mansion this holiday because he was with Alea in the dungeon.

Ethan was subtly keen on having regular conversations with Helmut.

It was too obvious to call him out at the academy, so he suggested meeting at the mansion instead. Ethan Kudrow was a good instructor.

“Ah, got it.”

Helmut nodded.

\*

As usual, the morning hours passed.

Basic training was always helpful. It not only loosened the body but also improved skills.

In swordsmanship, training is like firewood. You must continuously feed the fire to keep it blazing.

Neglect to add firewood even a little, and the flames will die down.

At noon, Helmut and Asuka headed to the bulletin board side by side.

As soon as class ended, a few curious ones had already rushed outside to the bulletin board. They were eager to be the first to see the notice.

“We’ll find out soon anyway.”

Asuka clicked his tongue in annoyance. Helmut and Asuka slowly reached the bulletin board.

Without even needing to look at the board, they learned where the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament would be held.

The students from the swordsmanship department gathered around the board were already buzzing about it.

The comprehensive swordsmanship tournament was to be held in the capital of the Princedom of Renosa, Britsha. It was a name that sounded unfamiliar.

Helmut recalled his memory of studying history.

The Princedom of Renosa was a nation in the eastern part of the Deus Empire, ruled by the Grand Duke of Renosa, a descendant of the imperial family of the empire.

Although not fully subjugated to the empire, it was significantly influenced and engaged in exchanges with it.

Renosa boasted a strong order of knights and was very wealthy.

The Grand Duke of Renosa, due to his lineage, could potentially aspire to the imperial throne, so the empire either kept Renosa in check or sought to foster close relations with them.

The people of the Grand Ducal family of Renosa received treatment in the empire akin to that of imperial royalty.

The Grand Duke not only participated in the noble assembly of the empire but also exercised powers as a royal.

Everyone chattered excitedly, united in their enthusiasm.

“Isn’t the Princedom of Renosa known for its beautiful landscapes?”

“And it’s also a very wealthy country. They’ll treat the participants extremely well.”

“I’ve heard there are many beautiful women there. Lucky you, Helmut!”

Someone who had spotted Helmut pointed him out and shouted.

Asuka’s face twitched, but even he couldn’t deny that Helmut was the favorite to win.



H.F.C Chapter 206 (Part 1):

`				`“How do you feel, Helmut? Are you confident? The qualifiers shouldn’t be a problem for you,” Asuka said, looking dissatisfied as he stepped away. Helmut replied lightly.

“If I participate, I have to win.”

He was slightly hesitant about entering the competition, even though Alea was encouraging him. There was the risk of attracting the temple’s attention, and Sian’s antics had made him wary, though Sian himself seemed unconcerned.

Applause erupted around him.

“As expected of Helmut!”

“That’s how a second-year top student in the swordsmanship department should act! Crush them all!”

The second-year swordsmanship students continued their excited conversation.

“If a second-year wins the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, it’ll be incredible, right?”

“Of course, it’ll be amazing. Our year will be on top!”

“The winner will be the best not just in our academy but among all the academies!”

“Obviously. It’s an official acknowledgment. It’ll be so thrilling.”

Undoubtedly, each academy would carefully select only the best to participate, for the sake of honor.

In such a competition, hiding one’s skills or holding back was unthinkable. Those confirmed to participate sharpened their skills to stand out. Proving one’s ability in front of everyone was what being a swordsman was all about. The swordsmanship students were eager to attend the competition for that reason.

Helmut, who had gathered information about Renosa in a short time, listened intently.

The conversation continued.

“Hey, if you win the swordsmanship tournament, by the time you graduate, everyone will line up for you. This time, the scale has grown, so it seems like everyone is paying attention.”

“Could Renosa be interested too? Renosa is known for treating knights well.”

“There are some students from the Principality of Renosa at our academy too, right?”

“I heard from the instructors that students from Renosa generally have the highest grades.”

“I heard that too, across all departments.”

“I heard a rumor that the Grand Duchess of Renosa is attending an academy here in Baden?”

“Really? If she’s royalty from Renosa, she must be very beautiful.”

“I heard from someone from Renosa who she is, but I promised to keep it a secret!”

Wesley boasted teasingly, and was immediately met with jeers from those around him.

“You idiot, then why mention it at all?”

“So, is she beautiful? That’s the important thing.”

“Well, is she or isn’t she? Do I know or not?”

Wesley smiled slyly, the kind of smile that made you want to hit him. The atmosphere around him turned hostile.

Soon, retribution typical of the swordsmanship department ensued. There was no way to avoid it with so many against him.

Wesley soon found himself being choked and screaming, with no one stopping it.

Helmut watched the scene indifferently, but one person suddenly came to his mind.

‘Could it be.’

Helmut shook his head. Things wouldn’t go that smoothly.

Another person crossed Helmut’s mind. Michael, the boy he met in Basor.

He said he was from the empire. To get to the Principality of Renosa, you had to pass through the empire. Could he run into him?

Michael, who couldn’t stand the heat, came all the way to Basor to watch the tournament and recruit talent.

He might be interested in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament. If he wasn’t bedridden after returning from Basor, it wouldn’t be strange for him to show up, even though he wasn’t attending the academy.

‘Will he recognize me?’

The disguise was off. He wouldn’t be acting as Hyde for a while.

Hyde, with his blonde hair and blue eyes, had a different impression from Helmut. Helmut’s black hair and black eyes were much more intimidating.

But Helmut was willing to bet that Michael would recognize him. Maybe not all his fortune, but a significant part of it.

Michael was an exceptionally perceptive and intelligent boy, even more so than Sian. And he was a unique type that Helmut remembered vividly.

‘Michael….’

Although there were some things that bothered him, it wasn’t a bad feeling.

Michael’s offer to make Helmut his own was still in question, but Michael had promised another meeting.

Helmut felt it wouldn’t be a distant future.

Anyway, the qualifiers were just around the corner.



H.F.C Chapter 206 (Part 2):

`				`The next day, Helmut was leaving the training ground when he happened to run into Charlotte.

“Hello.”

She was drenched in sweat, probably just finishing her training.

Unlike a lady of noble status, she was dressed plainly.

Charlotte had been putting more effort into her training than other students recently. Her desire to participate in the selection was stronger than anyone else’s.

She had taken the top spot among the first-year swordsmanship students, but the gap with the runner-up wasn’t significant. She needed to keep improving to maintain her position.

“Is your training going well?”

Helmut asked. Charlotte flinched and looked at him.

Helmut wasn’t the type to ask about someone’s well-being. He was more indifferent than just taciturn. Charlotte’s assessment was accurate.

However, to Helmut, Charlotte held a special meaning. Not in the same way as Alea, but still significant. That’s why he noticed her.

“I’m working hard. I want to pass the qualifiers too.”

“I see.”

Helmut nodded and passed by her. He had nothing more to say.

Just then, Charlotte called him.

“Senior.”

Helmut slowly turned around. Charlotte’s eyes were serious.

“I thought I should tell you, since you’ll find out anyway.”

Helmut looked at her curiously. Hesitant at first, Charlotte soon spoke with a determined expression.

“The person you mentioned before, that person is also in Renosa. If you go to Renosa as a representative of Greta Academy, you’ll have a chance to meet them.”

A sudden shock surged through his mind. His body felt frozen. It took Helmut a moment to respond.

“…You.”

“I’m from Renosa too. I want to go to Renosa by passing the qualifiers….”

Charlotte trailed off, looking down at her hands.

The swordsmanship tournament would continue until the start of the vacation. If she was going to Renosa anyway, it would be better to go as a representative of Greta Academy rather than just as a spectator.

Charlotte’s enthusiasm was understandable. More importantly, she had someone she wanted to show her achievements to.

To meet that person with her head held high, she had to pass the qualifiers.

“Well, that’s all.”

Charlotte bowed her head and walked away. Helmut watched her silently for a while.

His heart pounded. So quickly, the goal was in sight. An endless tension gripped his throat.

‘Margret Irene.’

His mother’s name. A vague emotion that was hard to label as longing.

Finding her was as natural as a salmon swimming upstream. That naturalness was absolute. Just like he had to leave the Forest of Roots.

But it was all too smooth. It made him suspicious, as if someone had orchestrated it to happen this way.

Surprisingly, Helmut realized he wasn’t mentally prepared.

Even though emotions were a dull thing for him.

An inexplicable chill ran down his spine. It was surprisingly similar to fear.

Helmut gritted his teeth.

‘First, the qualifiers.’

Securing his spot as a representative of Greta Academy in the comprehensive swordsmanship competition was the priority.

Helmut steadied himself.

The shock of Charlotte’s words hadn’t worn off.

Helmut spent the entire day in a daze, not even noticing the students around him whispering about him.

He swung his wooden sword like a man possessed.

Asuka also noticed something strange. He looked suspiciously at the second-year swordsmanship students.

“What’s going on? What did you do? Why are they acting like that?”

The answer soon became clear. At lunchtime, while Helmut was sitting in the student cafeteria, he heard an outrageous story.

One of the swordsmanship students, who had gathered around him, bluntly asked a question. They had been gossiping among themselves and couldn’t resist asking the source.

“Helmut, can I ask you something? What do you think of Charlotte?”

“What do you mean, what do I think?”

The question was so out of the blue that Helmut’s response was delayed.

“Come on, Helmut. Don’t dodge the question. Are you interested in Charlotte? You didn’t seem that keen on that pretty senior.”

Someone helpfully reminded him.

“Senior Teresa.”

“Yeah, did you dislike Senior Teresa because of Charlotte? What about your girlfriend? You’re a sly one.”

“Did you break up already? That could happen. Charlotte is pretty. And diligent. Her manner of speech is a bit stiff, but she has a cute side too.”

“Isn’t she your type?”

“No way! Anyway, Helmut, just answer. Everyone’s curious.”

Helmut was the top student in the second-year swordsmanship department. Although he often forgot it, everyone paid attention to him.

Because he was so unresponsive and indifferent, even trivial matters involving him became significant.

“I…”

Helmut was about to say he wasn’t interested, but he stopped because he couldn’t completely deny his interest. Instead, he said something else.

“Why is there such a rumor?”

“They said you were staring at Charlotte’s back longingly in front of the training ground?”

“And you asked about her well-being? That’s why there’s a rumor in the swordsmanship department that you’re interested in Charlotte!”

“Hey, you spread the rumor yourself.”

“The rumor was already out before I spread it! By now, the other departments probably know too!”

‘What is this nonsense?’

Helmut raised an eyebrow. He had met Charlotte in the morning. Only a few hours had passed.

How could a rumor spread so quickly? He wasn’t as famous as Alea, was he?

Helmut decided to deny it.

“That’s not true.”

“Oh, come on. You’re not the type to ask about someone’s well-being.”

“Right, why is Charlotte an exception?”

They were right. Helmut wasn’t the type to ask about anyone’s well-being.

“Even I don’t get asked how I’m doing,” Asuka said, looking suspiciously at Helmut with crossed arms. His gaze was sharp.

“Really, it’s not like that. I was just impressed by something Charlotte said.”

Helmut had to firmly deny it repeatedly. Even though he couldn’t reveal the conversation, it was difficult to dispel their doubts.

“What did she say?”

“Was it about Renosa? Now that I think about it, I heard Charlotte is from Renosa too.”

Wesley, who was about to say something, quickly clamped his mouth shut.

Fortunately, no one noticed his reaction. They were all focused on Helmut.

“I can’t say.”

Helmut answered the rest of their questions with silence.

The students trying to pry information from him eventually had to give up and leave, grumbling, unable to break through Helmut’s wall of silence.

But the suspicious glances didn’t disappear.



H.F.C Chapter 207 (Part 1):

`				`It seemed that the swordsmanship department had wrapped things up for now, but it wasn’t over.

Back in the dormitory, Helmut faced the same question from Sian.

“Hey, Helmut. What’s going on between you and Charlotte?”

His eyes were filled with curiosity. Helmut was starting to get tired of this question.

Asuka, who had been looking a bit off since earlier, suddenly kicked the ground.

“I’m heading in first.”

After he curtly said that and disappeared, Sian hummed.

“Is it a love triangle?”

“It’s not like that.”

Helmut cut him off firmly. Maybe Asuka was interested in Charlotte.

As far as he knew, Asuka never really talked about Charlotte or tried to speak to her.

While the swordsmanship department students would chatter about Charlotte, Asuka never joined in.

Sian smirked and added, “You’re too conspicuous. Especially now that the qualifiers are approaching. Your stories have even reached the magic department.”

“The magic department?”

Helmut furrowed his brow as he chewed on those words.

Alea was surprisingly well-informed about rumors. She might have heard something.

Helmut had told Alea he was looking for his parents, but he hadn’t mentioned Charlotte. That she might be related by blood.

That was just speculation.

‘It doesn’t matter.’

Alea had been engrossed in the dungeon recently and probably wouldn’t care about such trivial matters.

Helmut didn’t feel the need to explain it.

She would understand it was a misunderstanding. He had already told her that Charlotte was just a junior.

However, that night, Alea seemed strangely cold when they met at his door.

Her face was cold, and her responses were terse.

Helmut unconsciously asked if something bad had happened today.

Alea smiled slightly. It was a chilling smile.

“A very bad thing indeed.”

Then she asked,

“Don’t you have something to tell me?”

“Something to tell you?”

Alea knew about Helmut. She was sharp and observant but could be incredibly dense in some ways.

The gap was so large that sometimes he needed to speak plainly.

“Yeah, like the rumor that you’re interested in some junior girl?”

‘She was concerned.’

Helmut briefly denied it.

“You know it’s a misunderstanding.”

Alea crossed her arms.

“A misunderstanding? How would I know? You didn’t say anything.”

Helmut thought she would understand even if he didn’t say it, but he didn’t realize that some things need to be spoken out loud.

Thinking she was just angry, he denied it again.

“…It’s a misunderstanding.”

“Do I have to ask every little detail to know if it’s a misunderstanding or not?”

“We talked, I looked at her, and that’s how the rumor started.”

Helmut felt that Alea was sharp today.

Shouldn’t it end if it’s a misunderstanding? He started feeling a bit down. Didn’t she trust him? What about all the secrets they shared?

Helmut didn’t understand that trust and feelings could be separate. He had never faced such a situation.

“The reason doesn’t matter. The rumor is out there, and I find it unpleasant.”

“Even if it’s not true?”

“Even if it’s not true. Everyone will think there’s something between you and Charlotte.”

Charlotte herself would likely make a serious face over such rumors.

Helmut sighed lightly.

“What do you want me to do?”

So he understood why Alea was upset. He didn’t know how to fix it, though.

“They say you were the one who approached her first?”

“She greeted me.”

“Just because she greeted you? You don’t do that to anyone else. Why is she different?”

Suspicion filled Alea’s eyes. Fortunately, she was the type who didn’t have much patience for letting her imagination run wild.

She was the type to directly ask for an answer.

Helmut, who wasn’t good at guessing people’s feelings, found this easier.

“Charlotte is related to me by blood… probably.”

A sister or cousin, something like that. Alea looked shocked.



H.F.C Chapter 207 (Part 2):

`				`“What? What do you mean? I’ve seen her… well, she does look like you.”

Thinking hard about Charlotte’s appearance, Alea had to admit it.

“Remember when I told you about the pendant? She knew my mother’s name. She didn’t answer definitively, though.”

“You felt like she was close to your mother?”

“Yes.”

“Then you should have told me that.”

Alea’s eyes widened in protest. Helmut shook his head.

“I wasn’t sure.”

There are facts you can’t carelessly speak about unless you’re certain. Anything concerning his mother was like that.

Alea lowered her voice and asked,

“Then you can find out where your mother is. Why haven’t you gone to see her?”

“…Not yet.”

It was a hesitation mixed with many things. Alea understood his answer.

Her expression softened compared to earlier, and she muttered,

“Still, I don’t like it. Others don’t know.”

“You mean I shouldn’t talk to her?”

Although Helmut generally didn’t care, he thought that was a bit much.

“A greeting is fine. Just don’t act in a way that causes misunderstandings. Got it?”

Alea warned with a sly look. Avoiding misunderstandings? That was difficult.

How could he avoid misunderstandings just by looking at someone?

But Helmut didn’t argue.

“Okay.”

Anyway, it wasn’t hard for Helmut.

Talking to Charlotte like this had been an exception. He usually didn’t talk to anyone.

“So, what did you talk about with her?”

“Charlotte told me my mother might be in the Principality of Renosa.”

He had been thinking of telling her this. Alea’s face showed surprise.

“That’s…”

“When the swordsmanship tournament starts, I will go to Renosa and meet my mother.”

A heavy feeling came over him. Like a rock weighing down on his shoulders.

He had been waiting for this his whole life. But as it approached, it wasn’t light or entirely welcome. It felt like being caught in the current of fate.

“Should I do some investigation?”

“No.”

It seemed better not to know in advance. Alea realized this and said,

“Then I won’t see you for a while.”

“Probably. I thought you were more interested in the dungeon than me.”

Alea made a guilty face at his comment.

“It’s not entirely like that.”

“You can focus on the dungeon. With peace of mind.”

Helmut didn’t know it, but he had some resentment about it.

“It’s not like that. I’m also considering your training ground. I’ll try to have it ready before the vacation.”

Alea scratched her cheek.

“You can contact me with the first bracelet I gave you. I’ll upgrade it before you leave.”

Alea returned to her usual self, as if she hadn’t been angry.

“During the vacation… I might go to Renosa too, if you’re staying there.”

She was calculating the time. One of Heike’s conditions was that Alea spend part of her vacation with him.

But now Alea had Lampione’s legacy. Even if her willful, self-centered mentor would consider that and might adjust the schedule.

Heike was aware of Alea and Helmut’s relationship. Spending part of the vacation with him would be acceptable.

“Well, it will be after the swordsmanship tournament.”

Alea put her hand on Helmut’s shoulder encouragingly.

“Do well in the qualifiers. It starts tomorrow, right?”

Helmut quietly placed his hand over hers. Hoping this strange feeling would subside.

\*

The day of the qualifiers dawned. It was essentially a final exam, so even the talkative second-year swordsmanship students were quiet today.

Excuses like not feeling well wouldn’t work. Managing your condition was part of your skill.

First, the second-year students competed. The top-ranked ones would then face the top first and third-year students to select two final representatives from each year.

The qualifiers were like a preliminary for the tournament, so its format was similar. There was even a consolation match for the losers.

The round of qualifiers, which involved the top-ranked students, was held publicly in the academy’s affiliated arena, in front of spectators.

External spectators were allowed, so the audience was mainly citizens of Baden or those interested in seeing the swordsmanship department’s skills.

The announcement had been up for a while, and many were interested.

The tension on stage was incomparable to dueling in front of classmates or instructors.

Failing to show your skills under this pressure was also part of your ability.

The qualifiers were smooth sailing.

Helmut had fought stronger opponents on bigger stages. Winning back then hadn’t been hard, and it wouldn’t be hard against second-year academy students.

For Helmut, the word ‘condition’ was almost meaningless. He was used to fighting in peak conditions.

Unlike regular dueling, the qualifiers were closer to a real tournament. Real swords were used.

Helmut didn’t need to hold back and give opponents time to demonstrate their abilities like in duels.

“Helmut, victory!”

Hearing his own name declared in victory was exhilarating, even if this stage was insignificant compared to the martial arts tournament in Basor.

Helmut ended the match with a single strike. There was no need to swing twice.

Facing a real sword at their throat, his opponent froze, unable to block or dodge. It was an incredibly fast sword.

‘Too weak.’

Helmut thought calmly. His classmates should be somewhat on the same level.

But the gap grew daily. As if they were born different.

His classmates were herbivores, and he was a predator. Just as a rabbit couldn’t become stronger than a weak tiger, the gap between them was that significant.

‘Maybe someone like Asuka would be different.’

Helmut hoped. The result wouldn’t change, but at least it wouldn’t end in a single strike.

But he didn’t encounter Asuka until he reached the second round.

The draw separated the first and second rankers.

This wasn’t about choosing a winner, but filtering the top participants for the second round.

As expected, Asuka also advanced to the second round after Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 208 (Part 1):

`				`“Have all the kids been slacking off? Why are their skills like this?”

Asuka boasted confidently. He, too, finished most of his matches within a minute.

Asuka felt that the gap between himself and the other students had widened even more than before.

Since meeting Helmut, Asuka had been relentlessly training. His rate of improvement was astonishing.

When talent is combined with hard work, it’s like adding wings.

Asuka, too, was slowly outgrowing the academy level. If not for Helmut, he would have easily monopolized all the attention.

‘The representatives will be either me or Asuka.’

Helmut judged that to be a certainty, no matter how much effort others put in.

Although two representatives were to be selected across the first, second, and third years, both of them would come from the second year. Helmut and Asuka.

Asuka grinned and said,

“The kids from the Principality of Renosa must be disappointed. It’s a chance to compete in their home country. Just bad luck.”

At that moment, a figure flashed in Helmut’s mind. Charlotte.

“They say they’ll pick an additional reserve. If she makes it, who knows.”

“Yeah.”

Helmut replied briefly. If she performed well, she might make it as a reserve.

In Renosa, he would also find out the truth about his relationship with Charlotte.

At the venue of the second qualifier round, Helmut and Asuka encountered Charlotte.

Her face hardened as soon as she saw them. It seemed she had heard about the ‘rumors’ as well.

Charlotte, who mingled freely with her peers, would have been more plagued by rumors than Helmut. Everyone must have asked her about it at least once.

But since they had met face-to-face, they couldn’t pretend not to know each other.

She greeted them politely.

“Hello.”

“What? You too? Are there so few people in the first year?”

Asuka acknowledged Charlotte’s skills to some extent. But even as he recognized her, he spoke with a smirk.

Charlotte replied confidently,

“I’m the top student in the first-year swordsmanship department.”

“As if the spot will go down to the first years. Isn’t it a waste of time?”

While the surrounding first-year students flared up, Charlotte remained unperturbed. She wanted to go to Renosa more than anyone.

“You never know until you try.”

“Sure, sure. Well, good luck!”

“Yes, senior.”

Despite Asuka’s sarcastic tone, Charlotte showed no reaction.

Watching them, Helmut realized for the first time that Asuka had initiated a conversation with Charlotte.

Even if it was in a provoking manner, it was a surprisingly mild exchange for Asuka.

Asuka himself didn’t realize this, but Sian’s talk of a love triangle wasn’t entirely baseless.

Asuka, interpreting Helmut’s gaze, pointed a finger at him.

“Don’t be so confident. You never know the outcome.”

“Sure.”

Helmut responded indifferently. Unless he went into hibernation for about ten years, the gap between Asuka and Helmut was that significant.

Soon, Instructor Patricia appeared and announced to them,

“Everyone, compete fairly. Those selected will represent Greta Academy, so keep that in mind.”

Her glance at Asuka seemed to be a preemptive warning.

Instructors were objective. They already knew who would be the representatives.

Asuka snorted arrogantly, not understanding why he always got reprimanded.

Sighing inwardly, Instructor Patricia declared,

“Now, let the second qualifier round begin!”

The second qualifier round would span two days, including a loser’s bracket, to ultimately select two representatives.

Since the goal was the qualifiers, there were no additional awards even for high rankings or being chosen as a representative.

“Helmut! Step onto the stage.”

After a brief wait in the waiting room, it was Helmut’s turn. He glanced around as he stepped onto the stage.

The academy’s affiliated arena was more than half full. The atmosphere was charged with excitement.

Some students’ families from nearby Baden seemed to have come to cheer.

For a moment, he thought of Basor. Though there were no blazing sun or excited crowds here, and no opponents to match his skills, it was still a competition.

‘I guess I did enjoy the martial arts tournaments.’

When he thought of martial arts tournaments, he thought of him. The one who always cheered for him in the arena.

Helmut looked around for Michael. The boy with the bright blonde hair that stood out even at a glance.

But he couldn’t find him.



H.F.C Chapter 208 (Part 2):

`				`‘Good.’

No matter how well-informed Michael was, he wouldn’t come all the way to Greta Academy for what could barely be called a competition.

As Michael said, he wasn’t just playing around.

Helmut’s first opponent was a third-year student. The top student in the third-year swordsmanship department, no less.

Seeing that they had matched the top students from the second and third years from the beginning, it seemed the second qualifier round was randomly assigned. Just like a real tournament.

The opponent looked slightly nervous but had confident eyes. It was said that the top third-year student was significantly better than the runner-up. A typical honor student.

‘Even if he loses to me, he’ll probably make it through the loser’s bracket anyway.’

Helmut thought lightly.

“I hear you’re the top student in the second year? I’ve heard your name. Let’s see if you’re as great as the rumors say.”

The opponent narrowed his eyes skeptically. Helmut nodded.

“By all means.”

And in the match that soon began, the top third-year student avoided Helmut’s first strike but had to kneel at the second.

‘Better than the second-year students. Maybe I could’ve ended it in one strike if I adjusted the angle a bit more?’

There was room for contemplation. Glancing at his pale opponent, Helmut turned around.

To have reached the top at Greta Academy, he must have had considerable pride in his talent.

The shock was immense for someone encountering something so unfamiliar. But it wasn’t Helmut’s concern.

As Helmut walked away with his victory, the third-year students’ gazes changed.

The indifferent or wary looks turned into astonishment.

“What, it’s over already? They said your opponent was the top third-year student.”

Asuka, who was waiting, asked. Helmut simply nodded.

“Alright, I’ll finish quickly too.”

Asuka seemed determined, feeling a sense of competition. His opponents were clearly no challenge for him either.

\*

The second qualifier round proceeded quickly. There weren’t many participants to begin with.

Helmut and Asuka, being far from the loser’s bracket, finished the first day’s schedule quickly.

Helmut finished without much effort, and Asuka, too, ended without difficulty.

On the second day, the final representatives would be selected.

After the qualifier round, they would have some free time until they left for the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Asuka, waiting for his turn, muttered suddenly.

“Wouldn’t it be better to have an integrated qualifier round for all grades?”

Even if the qualifier round was integrated, Helmut and Asuka would still each take a spot as representatives. That’s what he meant.

Helmut pointed out simply.

“If they did that, the higher grades would monopolize all the roster spots. That wouldn’t be good in terms of inter-academy exchange.”

“Oh, I see.”

Asuka seemed uninterested.

Thinking about it now, he realized that leaving for another region for a swordsmanship tournament and living collectively with others didn’t suit him.

‘It’s annoying.’

Most of all, participating in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament might reveal things about him. Asuka didn’t like that idea.

Being tied down to academy life, representing Greta Academy, was not appealing.

Even a crazy dog like Asuka couldn’t run wild anywhere else. He had been quiet lately, but other academies wouldn’t look kindly on a commoner like him.

With the qualifier match nearly decided, various thoughts crossed his mind.

Asuka shook his head.

‘Still, I must win the qualifier match.’

It was a matter of pride. And Asuka achieved what he wanted.

“Asuka, victory!”

Charlotte looked down at her fallen sword, a glint of regret and disappointment in her eyes.

In the last match of the second qualifier round, her opponent was Asuka.

Charlotte, with her tenacious and adaptive swordsmanship, had fought her way up from the loser’s bracket, even defeating the top third-year student.

Despite her significant improvement, it was an enormous achievement.

That the top third-year student had lost to Helmut in just two strikes had left him in shock.

Asuka extended a hand expressionlessly.

“Get up.”

As she grabbed his hand and stood, regret showed on Charlotte’s face.

‘Is this the end…?’

She had done her best but failed to secure a spot as a representative to Renosa. Seeing her expression, Asuka asked,

“You really wanted to go to Renosa, huh?”

“Yes, I did. I’m from Renosa too.”

Asuka’s eyes widened.

“You’re from Renosa?”

“I thought you knew, considering you’re his friend… Was I wrong?”

“That guy isn’t kind enough to share such things. Well, anyway, you did well.”

Asuka spat the words somewhat displeased and turned away.

But he was lost in thought for a while.

\*

After the qualifiers ended, Instructor Alan called them over.

“Both of you did well. As expected, you performed excellently.”

“You knew we’d be selected, Instructor?”

Asuka asked provocatively, and Instructor Alan nodded.

“All the instructors predicted the same. We’ve been watching you. Anyway, let me briefly explain the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament again. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.”

But as his explanation continued, Asuka frowned.

“What? The tournament continues until the vacation?”

He scratched the back of his head, looking troubled.

“I can’t do that. I have places to go during the vacation.”

He had places to go, but more than that, he hated being tied down to academy life for the tournament during the vacation.

Helmut would be too busy training his swordsmanship to interact with him much.

‘It’s going to be extremely boring.’

Various reasons emerged for why he didn’t want to go. Instructor Alan tried to persuade him.

“Asuka, it’s a chance to make your name known as a representative of Greta Academy. For a commoner like you, it’s an excellent opportunity. You’ll gain honor through your performance in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.”

Asuka had enrolled as a commoner. Because of this, other details about him were unknown even to Greta Academy.

Asuka had thoroughly hidden his background. His wild behavior made it hard to believe he wasn’t a commoner.

Asuka snorted.

“I don’t need honor. My skill is my honor.”

There was already someone who endlessly talked about honor and status every vacation, and he was sick of it.



H.F.C Chapter 209 (Part 1):

`				`Instructor Alan frowned.

“So, are you saying you don’t want to participate in the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament? I think it would be a waste of your skill if you don’t participate.”

His words were sincere, but on the other hand, it was also a relief.

If Asuka decided to step back on his own, Instructor Alan had no objections.

Asuka was more than skilled enough to represent Greta Academy, but he posed problems in other ways.

A separate meeting was planned to discuss those issues, under a topic like ‘Measures to Restrain Asuka.’

“Well, yeah. Even after thinking it over, I can’t do it. I can’t spend my golden vacation in a place like that, no matter how scenic Renosa is.”

Asuka casually dismissed the opportunity that almost everyone in the swordsmanship department coveted.

Unless it was for tourism, he had no interest. Besides, Asuka had no desire to compete against students from other academies.

This wouldn’t be the last Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament, and there would be another chance next year. He had calculated this in his mind.

‘It’s better for someone who wants to go to go. Based on merit, that one will probably end up third.’

If he gave up, the opportunity would naturally go to the third-placer.

Since Charlotte was from Renosa, she would have to go to Renosa anyway.

“Fine, if that’s the case, there’s nothing we can do.”

Instructor Alan nodded. There would be no need for another round, just an announcement to Charlotte.

“Any more questions?”

When they both answered no, Instructor Alan told them to rest and readily turned his back.

As Asuka watched his retreating figure, a sudden thought struck him.

‘Wait, that means Helmut and Charlotte will be going together!’

For some reason, he didn’t like it. Asuka glared at Helmut, realizing how strange he was being.

Why would it bother him whether those two were together or not?

‘What does it have to do with me?’

Asuka changed his mind. It was silly for him to be concerned.

After all, Helmut had a girl who came with him during that festival.

But Asuka couldn’t let it go and asked,

“Helmut, you’re not interested in Charlotte, are you? I mean, do you like her?”

“I already told you I don’t.”

“Yeah, I figured.”

Asuka nodded. But soon he asked again, seemingly doubtful.

“Well, what if you end up developing an interest in her from being around her?”

Helmut cut off Asuka’s probing words without hesitation.

“There’s no reason for us to be around each other.”

While there might be some conversation, Charlotte was also mindful of rumors. There wouldn’t be many opportunities to get close.

All the selected participants would travel to Renosa for the tournament. Just because they were selected together didn’t mean they had to act together. They would be separated due to accommodations.

There were few girls in the swordsmanship department at Greta Academy, but Instructor Patricia was also expected to accompany them to Renosa.

‘Why is he so persistent?’

Helmut stared at Asuka. Feeling Helmut’s gaze, Asuka explained defensively,

“No, I was just worried you might develop feelings for Charlotte and bother her. She seemed uncomfortable with the rumors.”

Helmut cut him off sharply.

“Unnecessary worry.”

“Fine then!”

The way he waved his hand and turned his back seemed unusual. As if something had struck a nerve.

‘I suppose so.’

In any case, it didn’t matter to Helmut whether Asuka went or not. In fact, it was better this way.

Like before he got along with Sian, Asuka would try to cling to him, and whenever Helmut tried to do something, he would grumble about him wandering off alone.

That could get annoying, so it was more freeing to go alone.

Even if Asuka had feelings for Charlotte, it wasn’t his concern.

Thus, Helmut and Charlotte were chosen to represent the first, second, and third years of the swordsmanship department at Greta Academy.

Everyone at Greta Academy, including the instructors, felt relieved that Asuka wouldn’t participate.

They couldn’t predict what kind of trouble he might cause at the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.

Only one person was suspicious about the whole situation—Charlotte, who was going to Renosa.

She approached Asuka and asked,

“Is it because of me?”

“What are you talking about?”

Asuka frowned, aware of the gazes from the swordsmanship department students watching from a distance.

Charlotte, true to her straightforward nature, asked directly,

“If you’re giving up because I’m from Renosa…”

“What nonsense. Do you think I’d care about something like that?”

Asuka responded aggressively.

“I just don’t want to go. I have things to do during vacation too.”

By saying this, no one would suspect any other intentions.

Charlotte seemed to accept his words as she raised her eyebrows.

“Won’t you regret giving up such an opportunity?”

“It’s a great opportunity for you, but not for me. There’s always next year. Missing it once isn’t a big deal.”

Asuka spoke confidently. No matter how hard the first, second, and third-year students tried, they wouldn’t reach his level by next year.

Charlotte, still doubtful, said,

“If that’s the case, then good.”

Asuka seemed annoyed.

“Don’t misunderstand, I’m not one of your followers from the swordsmanship department!”

Charlotte was highly popular not only among first-years but the entire swordsmanship department.

She was a rare female student, skilled, and had a gentle personality. She was an unusual type.

Because of this, she had a following, and being treated as one of them hurt Asuka’s pride.

“I never thought that. Understood.”

Charlotte bowed and turned away. Asuka scratched his head as he watched her go.

He felt he had overreacted, but couldn’t pinpoint why.



H.F.C Chapter 209 (Part 2):

`				`“Geez, so annoying.”

That ignorance brought a feeling of vexation to Asuka.

He kicked a stray stone on the ground and left the place.

The students who saw him do that tilted their heads in confusion.

“At least Asuka doesn’t hit girls.”

“He’s been quiet lately, really mellowed out.”

“Charlotte is brave, talking to a mad dog like him.”

“Judging by his reaction, seems like there was some sort of fight.”

“Do you think Charlotte would pick a fight? With his temper, he’s just making a fuss on his own.”

This time, there were no misunderstandings like with Helmut.

At least, it seemed Asuka’s intentions had been successfully conveyed.

\*

A few days later, Charlotte heard someone call her name in front of the dormitory. It was an unfamiliar man.

“You must be Miss Charlotte.”

“That’s right.”

“Here.”

The moment she received the letter sealed with her family’s crest, Charlotte quickly hid it in her bosom, glancing around.

“Very well.”

The man who nodded and left didn’t seem to be from her family, just a mere errand runner.

As soon as Charlotte returned to her room, she took out the letter.

“Why would a letter come from Renosa, and in such an overt manner?”

When she opened it, her eyes widened.

She had expected it to be from her mother, but it was from an entirely unexpected person.

[To my beloved sister, the esteemed Charlotte.]

The moment she read the opening line, Charlotte pursed her lips in shock. But she wasn’t flustered, for this was just how Michael was.

‘Capricious and self-centered as always.’

That was the evaluation only Charlotte had of Michael, who easily won people’s favor with his charm.

The opening greetings written in smooth, affectionate words could almost be mistaken for a letter to a lover.

Whether Michael was being malicious or if his affection for his sister was suddenly welling up, Charlotte couldn’t tell.

Even though she thought Michael disliked her, sometimes she was confused.

Being fraternal twins, Michael was close yet distant to Charlotte.

Everyone was under the illusion that Michael thought specially of her, but Michael readily gave Charlotte the impression that he disliked her.

He mocked and teased her without hesitation.

Charlotte didn’t think it was because she was his only sister whom he felt comfortable with.

Michael felt inferior to Charlotte.

Her healthy body, her talent for the sword. Because she was born with the two things he didn’t have.

Charlotte understood his inferiority complex and yielded many things to Michael.

She had tried to improve their relationship, but it hadn’t worked out.

Michael showed a side to her that he didn’t show to anyone else.

He also monopolized their mother’s love using his weak body as an excuse.

It was only around the time Charlotte entered the academy that she realized it stemmed not just from an inferiority complex, but could be his way of keeping other potential heirs of the family in check.

Michael hated losing what was his and enjoyed taking or possessing others’ things.

Although hidden by his angelic appearance, he was very greedy and competitive.

Charlotte didn’t want the heir’s position. However…

‘If Michael doesn’t consider me his sister, there’s nothing I can do.’

At some point, Charlotte gave up on Michael. But she couldn’t help feeling hopeful at times.

Michael had a very strong, almost magical charm that drew people in.

Even as his sister, Charlotte wasn’t an exception.

Charlotte closed her eyes for a moment and then continued reading Michael’s letter.

He said he heard through his sources at Greta Academy that Charlotte was selected to represent the swordsmanship department.

The news must have reached him through the faculty, since Charlotte was from Renosa.

He congratulated her on achieving such a remarkable feat as a first-year and added that he regretted not seeing her last vacation.

‘I look forward to seeing you in Renosa.’

It was unclear whether Michael truly anticipated it, or if his heart had changed while Charlotte was away at the academy.

It could also be another trick to raise her hopes and crush them. Michael had a cruel side.

Like a child tearing off a butterfly’s wings.

“…Michael.”

Charlotte stared at her brother’s letter with complex emotions.

She wanted to return to Renosa as Greta Academy’s representative, as if to show him.

But now that it was happening, she felt uneasy. She pondered over it.

For now, all she could do was do her best for Greta Academy, having taken the opportunity Asuka gave up.

She put the letter down and decided to head to the training ground immediately.



H.F.C Chapter 210 (Part 1): The Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.

`				`The final qualifiers for Greta Academy proceeded smoothly.

A total of four candidates were chosen for the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Helmut and Charlotte, along with the other two candidates, were selected from the fourth and sixth years respectively.

Leon from the fourth year and Nils from the sixth year.

These qualifiers were made strictly according to the classification criteria of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, with lower years competing against each other and higher years doing the same.

This fact was once again announced by the instructor at a gathering of the four selected participants.

“Nils and Leon, Helmut and Charlotte will be in the same category. The match schedule will be arranged so they don’t face each other in the first round, but as they progress to higher stages, they might end up competing against each other, even if they are from the same academy. Think of each other as competitors, not comrades.”

Instructor Patricia explained clearly.

Charlotte glanced at Helmut. He was the senior who knew her mother’s maiden name. She realized belatedly that even their appearances were somewhat similar.

Helmut and Charlotte, both in the lower years, might face each other early on if they were unlucky.

For Helmut, it wouldn’t be a bad thing at all, but for Charlotte, it would be extremely unfortunate.

Helmut was a strong contender to win this tournament.

Charlotte knew this subconsciously.

But she didn’t ask to be spared from facing Helmut. Instead, she steeled her resolve.

‘Even if my opponent is Senior Helmut, I won’t just give in easily.’

The reason Michael went to Basor was to provide guidance on organizing a comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Basor’s martial arts tournaments were known for their tradition and history.

Among the numerous talents at the academy, Charlotte’s talent wasn’t outstanding, but it was quite noticeable.

It was a talent that could generally be called genius-level.

Considering she was a girl at a physical disadvantage, her talent stood out even more.

On top of that, she added effort. Charlotte prided herself on her diligence, unmatched by anyone.

The tournament was held in Renosa. It was a chance to show her accomplishments in front of her parents.

Charlotte hoped that this would draw her mother’s attention to her, to see what she had achieved at Greta Academy.

No matter how tough the opponent, she couldn’t afford to give up easily.

‘Even if realistically it might be difficult.’

Helmut sensed her lingering gaze on him for a moment. Charlotte’s existence felt strangely vivid.

As if his blood was stirring and instinctively provoked somehow.

Helmut rarely took notice of others’ presence. But there was something about Charlotte. That feeling grew stronger.

Helmut thought it was because of their bloodline. Perhaps a distant relative or cousin… or even a younger sibling.

He couldn’t guess beyond that.

His relationship with Charlotte would be defined after visiting Renosa and meeting his mother.

His heart throbbed slightly. Helmut was probably sent to the Forest of Roots from Renosa. The place where he was born and his life was erased.

‘If I go to Renosa, will I remember anything from when I was a newborn baby, the air, the sounds?’

The Seed of Darkness awakened his instincts. The name Renosa didn’t sound familiar.

But Helmut knew that if that was where he was born, he would feel something the moment he set foot on that land.

His heart raced, with a different kind of tension from the swordsmanship tournament.

Instructor Patricia looked at the four selected participants, almost expressionless.

“Charlotte is just a first-year, so I can’t expect much from her… but since she’s from Renosa, she might do well in a familiar environment.”

It would be rare for a first-year to be selected, even in other academies. The pride of the third and fifth-year swordsmanship students who weren’t selected was naturally hurt.

Especially for lower years. A first-year was selected while a third-year was not!

On the other hand, the first and second years were more enthusiastic. In fact, two candidates were effectively chosen from the second year. Asuka declined the opportunity, but still.

However, it was also true that Charlotte was in a position to seize that opportunity. She was third in line.

‘How curious.’

Instructor Patricia looked at the four alternately.

Nils, reaching graduation, had the bearing of a robust swordsman and occupied the most space in the view.

But the most noticeable among them was, indeed, Helmut.

Cold black eyes and black hair. Even Instructor Patricia sometimes felt an overwhelming presence from him.

A boy with a well of unknown depth in his skills.

If Instructor Patricia had to name one potential champion among these four, she could confidently say it would be Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 210 (Part 2): The Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.

`				`The virtue of a swordsman is silence, it is said, but even a chatterbox is fine if they have the skills.

But the four here were quite silent, as if they had planned it.

‘Better than being talkative. I’m relieved that Asuka isn’t here.’

Instructor Patricia nodded.

“We will depart for Renosa in a week. Until then, prepare your bodies and minds.”

“Yes!”

With the instructor’s words, they all left the assembly area.

Nils left first, then Charlotte bowed her head politely to her seniors.

“Well then.”

Helmut also turned to leave, but a voice from behind stopped him in his tracks.

“Wait, you there.”

Helmut turned around.

“Are you that guy who is friends with Alea?”

Leon, the fourth-year senior, gestured towards Helmut with his arms crossed.

Arrogance exuded from the noble-looking Leon. It wasn’t because Helmut was a commoner, but more of his general demeanor.

He was in good physical condition, and his body was well-built. But his gaze was devoid of any goodwill. The name seemed somewhat familiar.

Helmut retrieved his name from distant memory.

‘Xenia?’

When he took on the request to head to Baden, Xenia mentioned that her cousin’s name was Leon.

‘I heard he’s been making a name for himself at the academy.’

Helmut, not very interested in the swordsmanship department, didn’t know, but Leon was the top of the fourth-year swordsmanship department. And he would likely defeat Nils from the sixth year.

Leon spoke with a displeased face.

“Because of your friend, my cousin cried.”

Now he realized, Leon was hostile towards Alea.

Alea’s attitude was divisive.

Now that she could control the charm of her magic, this divisiveness was even more pronounced.

“Is that guy, who looks like a girl, really that great?”

It seemed Leon had intended to just disregard this guy Helmut based solely on what Xenia said, but it didn’t appear that way.

Out of affection for his cute cousin, he must have shared various stories about academy life with her.

“Alea is the top student in the second-year magic department.”

“Is that really such a great thing that allows ignoring and disrespecting a young lady?”

In their last meeting, Alea coldly ignored Xenia. She might have cried and complained to her cousin.

Leon cherished Xenia as if she were the apple of his eye. Leon pressed for an answer when Helmut hesitated.

“Answer!”

Helmut knew how to respond here.

But did he need to?

For some reason, a chilly feeling welled up.

The hostility toward Alea was soon hostility toward Helmut himself.

Although Xenia was a decent client who paid Helmut well, that was in the past.

Helmut responded briefly.

“She was annoying.”

Leon asked suspiciously.

“Does that mean you were there too?”

“Yes. And Alea dislikes being followed around. She should know that.”

Leon’s jaw tightened. It was a clear provocation. Even Helmut was surprised at himself.

Unlike Asuka, he had never deliberately caused conflict like this within the academy before.

He had become strangely sensitive. Was it because of the impending trip to Renosa? He felt a strange aggressiveness.

If Leon attacked, Helmut would just break him. An opponent as weak as a bug.

But Leon didn’t attack. He gritted his teeth and spat out.

“Fine. We’ll see, I’m looking forward to the trip to Renosa.”

Ever since entering Greta Academy, Leon had almost never lost.

His arrogance and confidence stemmed not only from his status but also from his solid skills.

Leon was confident that he was the strongest in the Greta Academy swordsmanship department.

Due to Leon’s authoritative and arrogant personality, the hierarchy was clear in the fourth-year swordsmanship department.

Everyone followed him and acknowledged his authority. Leon was the leader.

He intended to let the rudeness of Helmut’s friend slide with an appropriate apology, but how dare he respond like this!

‘Arrogant brat! He has no respect for his senior. I’ll make sure to teach him a lesson!’

Wasn’t his name Helmut? From the first time Leon saw him, there was something unsettling about the guy. His gaze, his whole demeanor.

He disliked the fact that this second-year was rumored to have skills comparable to upperclassmen.

Leon felt that only he deserved such a reputation from a young age.

Although it was a trip with the instructor, there would be opportunities. Leon sharpened his metaphorical blade.

\*

“We depart in ten days.”

Alea nodded.

“The time is rather tight, but it’ll be fine.”

“What will?”

“Just something.”

Alea mumbled. A shadow fell over her face. In ten days, they would part for a while.

Alea would go to Renosa during the holidays, but they would be separated until they met again.

Both felt an emptiness in their hearts at this fact.

Alea spoke softly.

“By the way, about that Charlotte… she’s traveling with you?.”

“Yes.”

Even though Instructor Patricia would accompany them, Charlotte would still be part of the same travel party. They might even spar.

Alea raised her eyebrows slightly.

“I’ve been thinking, it’s just a feeling that she might be related to you, right? So until it’s confirmed, you don’t know what kind of relationship it is. She might not be related at all.”

“…That’s right.”

“So it’s better if you don’t talk to her too much. She might misunderstand, you know?”

He seemed to understand what she was getting at.

“I don’t talk much anyway.”

Both Charlotte and he were quiet types.

And to be honest, they weren’t particularly close. Just a bit awkward, a bit bothersome.

“I see. Then that’s good.”

Alea smiled brightly. Helmut found himself gazing at her face for a moment, enveloped in an indescribable feeling.



H.F.C Chapter 211 (Part 1):

`				`Time passed quickly. There were no major changes during that period. Helmut waited patiently for the day of departure to arrive.

The anticipation was oddly exciting and yet oddly reluctant, like sailing towards a storm.

In that sea, he might find treasure, or he might be submerged forever. He couldn’t predict what would happen.

Perhaps he may even have to flee from there without revealing his identity.

There was no guarantee that his mother would recognize him, even with the name Helmut.

To his mother, he would be a dead child. It seemed like dark clouds were gathering.

Helmut found it difficult to fall asleep at night, an unusual occurrence for him.

To leave Baden, some preparations seemed necessary.

“Take this.”

The day before leaving, Alea called Helmut to her room and handed him a bracelet – one with enhanced functions from the previous one she had given.

Helmut alternated his gaze between the two bracelets on his wrist.

Strangely, it didn’t feel cumbersome.

Whether Alea had considered that, or because she was the one who gave the bracelet, he didn’t know.

“I’ll contact you at night. Answer when I call.”

Alea spoke firmly. Helmut quietly stared at the bracelet and asked doubtfully,

“Can’t I call you?”

It seemed unfair. It felt like he could only talk to her when she wanted to reach out.

Of course, Alea was the one who made the bracelet.

“You can call, but only when it’s dangerous.”

Alea pointed to a part of the bracelet. It would activate if infused with Vis.

The bracelet was initially designed to be used in dangerous situations.

But Helmut knew. He would never use the bracelet to call Alea.

He couldn’t drag her into danger if he was facing something he couldn’t handle.

“Next time we meet, I’ll have your training ground ready.”

She smiled lightly. She seemed to be planning to immerse herself in the dungeon for a while.

Although she was currently going through her final exams, it wouldn’t hinder her dungeon research.

No variable could take away Alea’s top position.

Alea left a brief remark.

“Win.”

As if it was a necessity. Or as if she believed he would.

Her amethyst-like eyes sparkled. It was a typical Alea statement.

Helmut nodded. He reached out his hand. Alea came close into his arms.

Her gaze came closer, a captivating look.

It seemed that during their time apart, he would miss her. He was certain of it.

\*

Before leaving, Helmut visited Ethan Kudrow in the morning. He had received a message that Ethan wanted to see him.

“Helmut, you’re here.”

Ethan Kudrow greeted Helmut with a pat on the shoulder.

His eyes were filled with a peculiar sentiment.

It hadn’t even been a year since Helmut sought him out.

But Helmut had distinguished himself so brilliantly that he was selected as a representative of Greta Academy for the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

In that short, yet long time, Ethan Kudrow had watched over Helmut.

From the moment he first saw him, this boy was extraordinary.

He had been impressed by Helmut countless times.

It was natural to think that Helmut was the disciple chosen by Darien, but that assumption of his became inadequate to explain Helmut’s evident ability.

To Ethan Kudrow, Helmut was not merely his benefactor’s disciple.

He was a boy with exceptional intelligence and extraordinary talent, one he held a special fondness for, like a special student or a son.

Helmut’s cold and disciplined nature, without any arrogance or recklessness, was captivating.

His ability to prove himself with his sword and skills was undeniable.

‘The light emanating from a person cannot be hidden.’

Ever since he entered the academy and began to stand out, no one could ignore Helmut.

He was a boy who attracted attention like a magnet.

This was possible because he was a gem.

Although Helmut seemed closed-off, harboring a cold and weighty secret.

Ethan Kudrow also knew. That Helmut was hiding something from him.

Even though he had softened a lot, Helmut’s sharp vigilance was subtly evident.

Though he had grown accustomed to the academy, Helmut still retained a raw, primal feeling.

Vivid like a beast, capable of turning dangerous at any moment. At times, it seemed almost inhuman.

Such a boy would not have an ordinary background.

‘Above all, his talent is unbelievable.’

Talent descended through bloodlines. Especially for Vis, this was the case. Helmut’s talent was exceptional – something unlikely for a commoner.

If such a thing existed, it would be nothing short of a miracle.

That’s why the Greta Academy was filled with nobles.



H.F.C Chapter 211 (Part 2):

`				`‘An orphan, huh…’

Ethan Kudrow grew newly curious about Helmut’s background.

Knowing that asking would only heighten Helmut’s wariness, he swallowed his questions but still wanted to share the burden.

Given that he tried so hard to hide it, it wouldn’t be a simple story. Ethan Kudrow wasn’t sure if he could handle it.

That’s probably why Helmut didn’t speak of it either.

Helmut looked into Ethan Kudrow’s eyes. Affection could be disguised but not hidden.

That’s how Helmut could sense Alea’s heart. And though of a different kind, the same was true for Ethan Kudrow.

Helmut knew that Ethan Kudrow cared for him beyond just overseeing him.

‘He has repaid his debt to Darien by simply accepting and sponsoring me at the academy.’

But Ethan Kudrow had done more. He had given his heart.

Even Helmut couldn’t remain untouched by that fact.

Even a wild animal recognizes the human who feeds it.

Even if Ethan Kudrow turned against him, Helmut could not easily end his life.

His sword was merciless. Yet, killing him would not be easy.

Therefore, he could never tell the truth. That much was certain.

Creating a situation that might require killing him was not the right thing to do.

Ethan Kudrow had things to protect, things he possessed, a position he had already established. It was better he didn’t know.

It is only proper that a human bearing the Seed of Darkness remains that way.

Only Alea, with the vessel of an Archmage, could handle Helmut and oppose the Temple with the resolve and capacity required, without being overwhelmed by the vast darkness that was Helmut.

‘But there are things I can say.’

Not everything needs to be said; Ethan Kudrow would understand. Helmut seemed to know that too.

“In Renosa, I think I will find out about my origins.”

“Do you have family left in Renosa?”

“Well, I’m going to find out.”

Helmut deliberately left it vague.

After a pause, Ethan Kudrow spoke calmly, having gathered his thoughts.

“Return safely.”

His words were different from Alea’s.

Alea had told him to win, as if she had no doubt he would be safe.

Alea knew Helmut’s strength. Ethan Kudrow also knew, to some extent.

But his words sounded like those of a parent.

“If you cannot return, I hope you’ll at least leave a message behind.”

Ethan Kudrow knew. He knew that Helmut might leave at any time and might never return.

Helmut was too great a bird for the small nest of Greta Academy.

After a brief glance, Helmut responded tersely.

“…Yes, I will.”

As he turned to leave, Helmut was seized by a lingering doubt.

His departure was imminent. A dark premonition once again enveloped him.

What would happen if he found his mother?

If she recognized and accepted him, would he stay by her side?

If she did not accept him…

His heart skipped a beat.

If his mother turned against him…

Helmut mulled over this grim hypothesis, tasting bitterness. Until now, although there had been crises, the path had been smooth.

And now, he was nearing the end. It had been barely a year since he left the Forest of Roots!

‘Is it too fast?’

Naturally and swiftly like flowing water, Helmut had resolved the tasks before him one by one.

It wasn’t necessarily bad, but it somehow invoked unease.

The reason Helmut had staked everything to leave the Forest of Roots was his mother’s voice.

Not only did he not wish to live out his life and die in the Forest of Roots, but his mother’s voice had become an intense call beckoning him.

It was still clear. Her voice, calling his name as if etching it into him.

Even if it changed somewhat over the years, Helmut felt he would still recognize his mother’s voice instinctively.

But had her heart, his mother’s heart, still not forgotten Helmut?

‘Mother…’

After all, more than a decade had passed. No matter that he was her son, they had not spent any time together.

Margret Irene might have already erased the name Helmut from her memory and heart.

Even if there was remaining affection, it was unlikely to be significant enough to risk her current status, especially as a noble.

Even if she felt a momentary joy upon seeing him, she might be horrified to discover that Helmut carried the Seed of Darkness and attempt to cast him out.

Perhaps it was better not to reveal his identity.

Although his name, appearance and age matched, Helmut was a commoner.

It could be passed off as a coincidence. It seemed like the safer choice. It was wise not to be greedy.

But Helmut felt a desire. He had experiences of success.

Perhaps she was the one he most earnestly hoped for. Not to be shocked or afraid of him, but simply to accept him as Helmut.

‘Alea accepted me.’

Alea was a mage. Even Archmage Antiol had casually accepted his presence, so perhaps mages could accept the existence of a boy with the Seed of Darkness.

It might have appeared as something with challenges to overcome.

Mages, inherently opposed by the Temple, might see it that way.

His mother was not a mage, and he knew her thoughts would be different.

But he could not resign himself to giving up, having succeeded in every adventure so far.

‘First I’ll meet her.’

He could think about it later. Helmut put his thoughts on hold.

Soon, he would depart for Renosa.



H.F.C Chapter 212 (Part 1):

`				`“Helmut, take care and make sure to win it!”

“See you next year!”

In the morning, Asuka and Sian kept waving their hands.

Though they still had exams left, it didn’t matter to spend time like this.

Their second-place positions were virtually guaranteed anyway.

When he returns, the new semester would have started. The winds blowing in Baden may have changed a bit by then.

‘Though it’s not even certain if I’ll return.’

There was nothing certain about himself, but at least they were here. And Alea too.

At that moment, he felt a gaze from an upper window. Something like a purple shard sparkled by the window.

She must be looking down from there.

They had shared enough greetings last night. Even if they couldn’t see each other’s faces, they could still keep in touch.

Alea had said she would contact him.

Helmut lowered his gaze from there. Four people were waiting by the prepared carriage.

“How brazen of you to be the last one here.”

Leon clicked his tongue with a confrontational tone.

His behavior, even in front of the instructor, was without hesitation because he had that much standing in the swordsmanship department.

He had a face filled with resentment towards Helmut. He seemed full of determination to make the upcoming journey exhausting.

It didn’t matter. It didn’t bother him much.

Just, it was a pity. Helmut contained the rising murderous intent.

‘Killing him would be problematic. After all, he is the academy’s representative.’

How about disguising it as an accident? No, there might be high priests at their destination.

Without Alea accompanying him, a perfect cover-up would be impossible.

He might step on him if the opportunity arose, but he couldn’t kill him. Especially because of the Seed of Darkness.

‘An opportunity will come.’

He knew from past experiences that such people were persistent.

His conflicted heart settled back into calm. A peacefulness familiar to Helmut.

He also knew it was useless to conflict.

Most situations he faced were ones he found answers to only after confronting them.

The only things to trust were his body and sword. If he stayed true to the path ahead, a conclusion would arrive.

Instructor Patricia interrupted the conflict as if to prevent it.

“Everyone, get on the carriage quickly. We allotted extra time in case of any variables, but we have no more time to waste.”

Though it was a long journey, the luggage was piled high, the number of people was not many.

One professor from the magic department and two instructors from the swordsmanship department were accompanying.

A total of seven people.

Three carriages awaited them. The two swordsmanship instructors were Patricia and Alan.

It seemed their relationship was still undisclosed.

Or perhaps they thought it more appropriate to go together because of their relationship.

Professor Luxen from the magic department looked at Helmut.

“You’re the student who took my Understanding of Magic class in the first semester?”

“Yes.”

“Your answers were impressive, I remember. Of course, your handsome face too. I didn’t expect you to be the top student of the swordsmanship department. Your answers were so good for someone from the swordsmanship department that I wondered if you chose the wrong field.”

Helmut recalled the answer he had written.

Was it about the power of darkness? At that time, Helmut had written an answer that opposed the temple.

Being a mage, he might not care about it, but Helmut wondered if he had noticed something, and glanced at him.

He couldn’t read any specific intention from the smiling old professor.

“What are you saying? Professor Luxen, Helmut is the treasure of the swordsmanship department.”

Instructor Patricia quickly cut in as if not to let anyone covet him.

“Helmut is such a model student that he must have diligently responded even in written exams.”

“Haha! Is that so. It’s not easy to get such good grades in my class without being a student of the magic department…”

After exchanging a few more words of praise for Helmut, they got into the carriage.

Leon also got on the carriage with a face as if he had bitten a bug.

It was the first time he had experienced not being the center of attention in front of the instructors in a gathering of students.

Helmut happened to be in the same carriage as Instructor Patricia and Charlotte, whom Alea had warned him to avoid.

“Nice to meet you, senior.”

Charlotte bowed her head in greeting.

She was polite but not servile. She maintained her dignity while being respectful.

She was definitely not a commoner. Then what position among the nobility?

Helmut couldn’t easily guess.

“Do you have something to say to me?”

Sensing his gaze, Charlotte asked with wide eyes.

She and Helmut looked very alike. But unlike Helmut’s sharp impression, Charlotte had a neat yet somewhat gentle face.

There was no coldness that repelled others in her. Was it because of her character?

“Nothing.”

It would be troublesome to cause any misunderstanding. At any rate, Charlotte had no inkling about Helmut’s true identity.

Though he wouldn’t have any reason to like Charlotte, he had to consider the possibility that she might have a liking for him.



H.F.C Chapter 212 (Part 2):

`				`Instructor Patricia chuckled as if teasing.

“Helmut, Charlotte! We have the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament ahead! It would be troublesome if male and female students fall for each other.”

“Fall for each other? That’s a bit improper.”

Charlotte seemed to take it seriously, as if she really didn’t want such a misunderstanding.

Fortunately, she didn’t seem to have any feelings for Helmut.

Charlotte was a model student cherished by Instructor Patricia and also someone who was fun to tease.

She subtly smiled.

“Why? It’s possible to fall for each other. A journey with healthy male and female students together. Besides, isn’t Helmut very handsome? Though he’s clueless, I hear there are girls who secretly like him.”

‘Is that so.’

Helmut himself was completely unaware of this. It was partly because Alea had been blocking them without him knowing.

“That’s true, but Helmut senior is not my type.”

Charlotte said firmly.

Helmut felt somewhat strange. It was the first time he experienced being told he wasn’t someone’s type to his face. No one would feel good hearing that.

Of course, for Helmut, it was just a novel experience.

Charlotte realized her mistake and slightly bowed her head.

“My apologies.”

“Then what is Charlotte’s type?”

Instructor Patricia asked insinuatingly.

This question piqued Helmut’s interest a bit. He thought of someone who had been glancing at her while pretending to greet.

After some serious consideration, Charlotte answered.

“I suppose someone with good conduct and maturity would be nice.”

‘Asuka is out of the question.’

Helmut concluded simply. Even if Asuka were reborn, it would be impossible to meet Charlotte’s standards.

Maybe he’d change by the time he was on his deathbed.

Helmut, who didn’t want to be connected to Asuka by any family relationship, was pleased with this.

“What about appearance? Don’t you look at the face?”

“I think it’s impolite not to prioritize the inner qualities when looking at a person.”

Instructor Patricia was sure. If it were Charlotte, she would have scored full marks in Greta Academy’s ethics test.

But soon, Charlotte added.

“However, since I’m still lacking myself…I’d prefer someone good-looking if possible. But of course, the inside is more important.”

She added firmly and then turned her head toward the window of the carriage, seemingly embarrassed.

Instructor Patricia chuckled.

“Honest, I like it.”

Helmut felt a faint ember of hope glowing in the darkness. It was a hope he thought had completely extinguished in Asuka.

It seemed there might be a slim chance for him. Even if it was a very low possibility.

\*

“Senior, is this Helmut guy really that great?”

Having been deprived of the faculty’s attention as the swordsmanship department’s representative and not being able to sit in the same carriage as Charlotte, whom he secretly had an interest in, Leon was annoyed.

He didn’t like that Helmut guy in many ways.

He asked his senior, Nils, in a tone that sounded as if he was addressing a subordinate.

In the swordsmanship department, strength determined rank. A higher grade might grant some privileges, but…

In Greta Academy, the hierarchy was especially clear. At the point of graduating, there was a limit to how much more they could improve.

Nils was aware of being beneath Leon. He answered calmly.

“Rumor has it he defeated a first-rank mercenary-level assassin.”

“First-rank mercenary-level? It’s just a rumor. There’s no way a second-year could do that.”

“If the instructors said it, it’s not just a rumor.”

“That’s…”

Leon’s face hardened. But he soon changed his expression.

“Anyway, the guy is arrogant, isn’t he?”

“Yeah.”

Nils responded lightly. Leon spoke in an insinuating tone.

“There’s a way to teach an arrogant junior in the swordsmanship department’s way. I’ll have to show him.”

Nils looked at him indifferently and nodded. It didn’t matter to him anyway.

He couldn’t stop Leon, and minor quarrels were common in the swordsmanship department.

If it went too far, the instructors would intervene. But as the senior-most student in the group, he added one more word.

“I hope there won’t be any big commotion.”

“Of course.”

Leon smiled with a cold face.

\*

The first campsite after leaving Baden. As the faculty stepped aside to discuss the schedule, the four students were left alone.

While unloading the luggage and tying up the horses, a call came from behind.

“You, Helmut!”

It was an unwelcome voice.

“Don’t you hear the senior’s words?”

Helmut responded indifferently.

“Yes.”

“Go fetch some water. It’s your job.”

Leon ordered arrogantly, pointing towards the water container.

Helmut’s eyebrows raised slightly. A new feeling. Fetching water was a task for a fourth-rank mercenary, the very bottom, among mercenaries.

This guy was currently treating Helmut as a grunt.

But Helmut decided not to get angry or retaliate.

If Leon’s hierarchy was based on grade, it shouldn’t be Helmut doing the task.

Helmut pointed to the water container and ordered.

“Charlotte, go fetch the water.”

“Yes.”

Without a word, Charlotte stepped forward.

It didn’t make sense for Helmut, a second-year, to do the work while Charlotte, a first-year, just sat there.

Even if her original status didn’t fit such tasks.

Nils, who had been watching, had a bewildered expression.

He also didn’t particularly like Helmut. His reason differed from Leon’s.

He simply didn’t like the dangerous aura Helmut seemed to exude.

But he didn’t expect Helmut to dodge the task like this.

Charlotte immediately picked up the water container. Her hands firmly grasped the heavy container’s handle.

“Then I’ll be back.”



H.F.C Chapter 213 (Part 1):

`				`‘What on earth is this brat doing now? How dare he act like that towards Charlotte!’

Leon was worried that Charlotte’s impression of him would worsen because of this situation. His face puffed up with anger as he spoke coldly.

“Charlotte, stop. I told Helmut to do it.”

“It’s my job to do.”

Charlotte did not back down. She knew Leon was trying to establish hierarchy over Helmut.

It wasn’t out of an intention to shield Helmut. If Helmut told her to do it, it was right for her to do it.

Helmut responded indifferently.

“She says it’s her job.”

It sounded somewhat provoking. Leon, holding back his anger, shouted at him.

“Do you even think? How can you make a small girl do such a thing!”

Most of the students in the swordsmanship department were large and muscular. Compared to them, Charlotte, being a girl, looked small and fragile.

Despite the fact that she was the top student in the first year of the swordsmanship department and knew how to handle Vis, making her do this task seemed inappropriate.

Of course, Helmut was free from such notions.

In the Forest of Roots, even the most beautiful flowers could devour humans.

He knew Charlotte was strong, beyond what was visible to the eye.

“It’s my job to do this. Senior, I’m not weak. I can carry a water bucket.”

Before Helmut could say anything, Charlotte interrupted sharply, her eyes showing she felt insulted.

She quickly shouldered the water bucket and walked away.

Leon’s face turned icy as he gritted his teeth at Charlotte’s reaction.

‘Could Charlotte really be interested in that guy?’

It couldn’t be. But Helmut, with his impressive appearance, was indeed eye-catching.

Leon felt a surge of resentment. He didn’t know Charlotte well, but based on her striking looks and character, he assumed she was from a high-ranking noble family.

Most noble girls pursued academics or magic.

A noble girl discussing swords was extremely rare.

This rarity piqued Leon’s interest in Charlotte. Winning her over would undoubtedly be valuable.

He had planned to cautiously approach her during this opportunity, but it was ruined from the start.

Because of that Helmut!

As soon as Charlotte disappeared, Leon lashed out in a harsh tone.

“Since entering Greta Academy, I haven’t had much contact with commoners, so I didn’t realize how lowly they are! Making a woman do your job is truly a commoner’s thinking. I must have overestimated you!”

It was true that studying alongside commoners was unpleasant for Leon, but he was at the pinnacle of the swordsmanship department.

To begin with, the bootlickers around him were all nobles.

Naturally, he hadn’t had many opportunities to express his discriminatory attitude towards commoners.

The academy’s education also regulated such behavior.

However, at the moment a commoner annoyed him, his consciousness leaked out.

If there was a visible flaw, he had to pick at every fault.

Leon faithfully adhered to the principles of combat.

Helmut responded swiftly.

“It seems Charlotte doesn’t agree with your thoughts, senior.”

“Don’t you dare call her by her name!”

‘What’s going on here?’

Helmut’s brow furrowed. It felt like he was caught in the middle of a romantic feud. The problem was, Helmut had no intention of fighting over Charlotte.

Unable to watch any longer, Nils intervened. He thought Leon went a bit too far with the commoner remarks.

He was a principled person, but that didn’t mean he wanted to side with Helmut.

“I heard Charlotte is from Renosa. Heading to Renosa now, it doesn’t look good to assign such chores to a noble from Renosa.”

Helmut tilted his head slightly.

When they reach Renosa, they’ll be staying in lodgings with servants anyway.

The academy-selected students would be treated accordingly.

So there was no problem doing menial tasks until then. The Renosa people wouldn’t know.

In any case, Helmut had no intention of doing whatever Leon instructed, and Charlotte didn’t refuse the assignment. That was enough.

Helmut cut him off coldly.

“Whether she’s from Renosa or not doesn’t matter in doing the given tasks.”

If she didn’t like it, she could refuse. If Charlotte refused, Helmut would say he wouldn’t do it either.

Leon was just being annoying. He could just challenge him to a duel directly.

Finally, Leon moved as Helmut had expected.

“Fine, I see you’re not getting it. I need to fix your attitude!”

Leon stood up abruptly, holding a wooden sword.

Had he been looking for an excuse to beat him up?

‘It won’t go as you wish.’

Helmut looked at him indifferently. He was tired of dealing with weaklings.

It was a bit inconvenient too. He had to control his strength to avoid killing him.

Ironically, Leon seemed confident he would win.

Even though he had never seen Helmut’s skills!

He would soon realize that it was a big mistake, and who the real contender for victory among Greta Academy’s selected students was.



H.F.C Chapter 213 (Part 2):

`				`However, before they could clash, there was an intruder. The Instructors, who had just finished their discussion, appeared.

Seeing the confrontation between Leon and Helmut, they paused.

There was no romantic tension between Instructor Alan and Instructor Patricia during work.

Sensing the unusual atmosphere, Instructor Alan crossed his arms and asked.

“What happened?”

Leon quickly denied. A fabricated smile appeared on his lips.

“Nothing. I was just about to duel with a junior, but it doesn’t seem like the right time.”

There was no benefit to fighting in front of an instructor. He wasn’t really looking for a dueling match anyway.

Instructor Alan didn’t ask further. He judged that intervening in trivial quarrels would have negative effects.

‘Helmut isn’t particularly aggressive, but he strangely attracts fights.’

Maybe it was because of his cold and intimidating demeanor.

Helmut had a knack for provoking swordsmen.

The ambiguity of his skills. His appearance was almost delicate, but his aura wasn’t, creating a contradiction that made others want to challenge him.

Unable to judge, they had to test him.

This was why Helmut often got into fights in Basor.

Instructor Patricia looked around and asked.

“Where’s Charlotte?”

“She went to fetch water.”

In truth, they had brought enough drinking water, and there were mages as well.

There wasn’t a real shortage of water. Instructor Alan frowned.

“Fetch water… Well, maybe it’s because she’s a first-year student. But it’s better not to act alone. This isn’t Greta Academy, so we don’t know what might happen. Always stay together. Helmut, go to the water’s edge.”

“Yes.”

Helmut readily left.

When he reached the water’s edge, Charlotte was sighing deeply with a fully filled water bucket in front of her.

Her face was filled with worry.

‘Is it too heavy for her to lift alone?’

Helmut thought she wouldn’t be that weak, but he asked.

“Is it too heavy for you to carry?”

Charlotte turned around in surprise. Only then did Helmut realize that he had been deadening his footsteps.

It wasn’t that he was trying to ambush someone, it was just a habit. Especially in forests like this.

“You move so quietly, senior.”

Charlotte looked embarrassed, as if ashamed of letting her guard down in a place where she could be attacked at any time.

“I can carry it alone. I was just about to head back. I had something on my mind for a bit. You can go ahead.”

“The instructor said not to act alone.”

“…I see. Then could you give me a moment?”

Charlotte’s expression darkened. Judging by her overall condition, she wasn’t physically unwell.

It was probably a matter of the heart.

‘Could it be because I made her do this task?’

He didn’t know why that would upset her, but he had something to say.

“It wasn’t me who made you do it.”

Helmut himself was aware that he hadn’t done anything wrong, but from the reactions of the other two seniors, he wondered if he had done something strange.

‘I’m still not fully accustomed to the human world.’

But Charlotte nodded readily.

“I know. However, regardless of that, it didn’t seem right to unnecessarily have juniors run errands for the sake of establishing hierarchy.”

She added an unnecessary comment, typical of her. Charlotte wasn’t a fool.

“If I was upset over that, it’s not your fault, senior.”

If it wasn’t Helmut’s fault, it was Leon’s. The conclusion was clear.

There was a brief silence. In the place where only the sound of the stream flowing could be heard, the silence was not too noticeable.

Both were not talkative. Helmut waited leisurely while standing, and Charlotte was lost in thought, watching the flowing water.

Suddenly, she raised her head.

“Senior, I have something to ask.”

“What is it?”

If it was about Margret Irene, he couldn’t tell her.

Helmut hadn’t decided what to do yet.

But Charlotte’s intention was different.

“It’s a trivial concern, but I have no one to ask. I thought you’d listen without any judgment…”

Her words implied that he was insensitive enough to listen to anything without reacting.

But Helmut wasn’t offended. He was indeed indifferent.

“Go ahead.”

“Please don’t tell anyone.”

For a moment, Alea crossed his mind.

Should he keep it a secret from Alea too?

Didn’t she repeatedly tell him not to talk much with Charlotte?

But Helmut trusted his instincts. Charlotte was his blood relative.

After a moment of hesitation, he replied.

“I won’t.”

Charlotte’s voice flowed out slowly.

“What would you do, senior, if your sibling disliked you?”

“I don’t know because I don’t have siblings.”

Isn’t it an emotion one can understand only after having siblings who dislike them?

Humans kill their siblings and parents for power. Is it a big deal if siblings don’t get along?

Charlotte seemed to be troubled by this fact.

“If not siblings, then let’s say relatives. The term ‘family’ would work too, I suppose. What would you do if someone you couldn’t ignore disliked you, senior?”

She was worried about Michael.

Since leaving Renosa, her heart had been restless.

Michael had sent another letter. He wanted to see her face as soon as she arrived in Renosa.

She didn’t understand why he was acting like this suddenly.

It couldn’t be that his heart had softened from not seeing her for a long time. The Michael she knew wasn’t such a tender boy.

So, it troubled her even more.



H.F.C Chapter 214 (Part 1):

`				`‘What could be his intention?’

He may have initially seen Charlotte as a rival, but now he seems to be trying to absorb her.

There was always a reason behind Michael’s kindness. The reason he didn’t attend the academy wasn’t simply due to his health issues.

It was to solidify his position as the heir of the family while Charlotte was away.

When Charlotte returns, everyone in the family will likely be following Michael.

Helmut’s answer was simple.

“Why don’t you ask him why he dislikes you?”

First, she needed to confirm whether he disliked her or not, but after that, the reason was crucial.

Charlotte spoke again.

“I know why he dislikes me. But yes, I’ve never actually asked him.”

She could only guess. Charlotte found Michael difficult.

It seemed she had never once gotten angry with him.

Charlotte merely endured Michael’s biting remarks and his hostility.

She carried that vaguely understood reason within her.

“What will you do once you find out why he dislikes you?”

“I’ll just leave it be.”

Charlotte’s eyes widened.

“Don’t you feel like you should…do something about it if you were in a similar situation?”

“Well, I don’t know how to change someone’s heart.”

Helmut had never learned how to do that, and he knew he wasn’t good at it.

The idea that a sibling might dislike him wasn’t surprising.

Even if his mother accepted him, Helmut was still an outsider.

It wouldn’t be easy for his siblings to accept him just because they shared blood.

Nobles had a lot to lose. Would they really welcome a sibling who might divide their inheritance?

Helmut had no intention of disrupting their order. He had no need for wealth; he already had plenty.

Of course, things might be different if they ever met.

Even without knowing about the Seed of Darkness, if Helmut’s mere existence bothered them, there was nothing he could do about it.

If he couldn’t beat them up to establish a hierarchy or kill them, the answer was simple.

Just face them. But the moment of confrontation had not yet come.

It was too early to think about potential siblings who might or might not exist and how they would treat him.

Helmut calmly responded,

“But I know what I have to do.”

Charlotte suddenly realized. What’s important now isn’t Michael’s heart, which she may or may not find out even after meeting him.

It was the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.

Helmut had an impressive ability to reach conclusions quickly.

Helmut’s resoluteness dispelled Charlotte’s worries.

Even though she was aware, she still got lost in her thoughts. Now, her mind was clear, and she nodded.

“I see.”

It felt strange yet amazing. Charlotte had always been impressed by Helmut’s strength, his swordsmanship, and his diligence.

As a fellow swordsman and senior, there was much to learn from him.

Though she didn’t have feelings for him, she thought of him as a good senior.

“You’re right, senior.”

“Let’s go.”

Helmut suggested briefly. He calculated in his mind that the conversation wasn’t too long.

Charlotte seemed to notice something and stood up.

“Oh, I heard you have a fiancée or girlfriend. My apologies, she might be displeased.”

Helmut flinched and replied.

“She probably would be.”

But what’s done is done. He decided to ask something as well.

“If you’re from Renosa, you must have family there.”

Helmut asked casually. Charlotte hesitated and said.

“Yes, that’s right. If you go to Renosa… you might be surprised.”

“Surprised?”

“Yes, because my family is a bit…”

Charlotte hesitated. Should she just tell him?

He would find out eventually, but telling him now would break the academy’s rules.

Even if it did, no one would know she broke the rules unless Helmut spoke of it.

Just as Charlotte decided to speak, a cold voice interrupted from a distance.

“What are you doing there? Have you been dawdling all this time?”

It was Leon. As he walked down the slope, he threw a fierce gaze at Helmut.

Leon was concerned about Helmut and Charlotte being alone and had come to check on them.

Seeing them talking made him uncomfortable. They seemed quite close, and it twisted something inside him.

“My apologies. I was just about to leave.”

Charlotte quickly grabbed the water jug and moved.

She didn’t seem to notice the heavy weight of the jug.

Charlotte left first, and Helmut was about to return to the camp.

However, as he passed Leon, Leon suddenly spoke.

“She’s a noble. You’re a commoner.”

The tone suggested that he shouldn’t be looking at an unattainable tree. Helmut calmly asked.

“Aren’t we all students of the academy?”

“Once you leave the academy, you won’t be. Although we follow the academy rules inside, everyone knows that fact. It seems you don’t know.”

Even if he knew, it didn’t matter. Would the noble status protect his neck from Helmut’s sword?

Probably not. This guy didn’t even have the skills to ensure that.

Helmut looked at him with cold eyes.

Meeting those chilling black eyes, Leon felt an inexplicable intimidation.

However, he tried hard to pull himself together.

No matter how ominous those pitch-black eyes looked or how strange a feeling the other person gave off, he was just a second-year student. It didn’t make sense for him to feel intimidated!

Leon gritted his teeth and asked.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“Senior doesn’t like me.”

“Yes, and what will you do about it?”

Helmut’s gaze deepened, as if a chasm was opening in his eyes.

“Then instead of being a nuisance, let’s duel.”



H.F.C Chapter 214 (Part 2):

`				`The instructors didn’t monitor them all the time.

They could secretly clash at night, or if he didn’t like that, they could officially challenge each other.

Helmut was thinking it might be simpler to resolve it through a show of strength.

Leon’s face turned red with anger.

“What? You think you can beat me?”

“Of course.”

Helmut answered briefly, a slight smirk on his lips.

“Why don’t you find out? I’d prefer using real swords.”

He had heard that the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament used real swords.

It was closer to actual combat compared to tournaments held within the academy.

The feel of a real sword was different from a wooden one.

In a real sword duel, he could pretend it was a mistake and put the opponent in a more dangerous position.

Of course, he wouldn’t kill him.

Professor Luxen from the magic department would be there. As long as he didn’t die instantly, it wouldn’t be too difficult to handle such situations.

Anyway, as long as they arrived at Renosa safely, that’s all that mattered, right?

Whatever murderous thoughts Helmut had, Leon was unaware.

He was filled with the anger of having to teach this arrogant second-year a lesson.

But Leon was also an outstanding swordsman. If not for Helmut, he could represent the entire academy.

An outstanding swordsman should be able to assess the situation.

They can’t fight with agitated minds. What if he ended up killing this guy?

Leon knew Helmut was one of the selected students from Greta Academy. Causing trouble openly wasn’t Leon’s style.

He was also concerned about the instructors’ evaluations and his own reputation.

That’s why he had only prodded lightly.

Barely containing his anger, Leon asked.

“You mean you won’t avoid the duel?”

“I have no reason to.”

Helmut’s tone was indifferent. If the other side provoked him, he could provoke back.

A confrontation would be simpler.

‘Arrogant brat!’

To Leon, Helmut’s words sounded dismissive.

Leon didn’t think Helmut had any basis for his confidence. His pride didn’t allow him to believe Helmut was better.

Even though he had heard about Helmut’s reputation, his pride blinded him.

It should have been easy to understand.

A commoner wouldn’t be so confident unless he had the skills to back it up.

Leon composed himself and spoke in a calm tone.

“Fine, I’ll inform the instructor. We’ll have a duel.”

“You plan to duel in front of everyone?”

That would be appropriate, but it felt a bit disappointing.

Helmut had been relatively quiet since the first semester’s quarrel.

He would have to hold back in front of the instructors. A hint of killing intent flickered in his black eyes.

Leon proudly declared.

“Yes, of course. You will understand your own skill and position clearly in front of everyone!”

“Let’s do that then.”

Helmut replied indifferently. He turned away. The matter would be resolved before they reached Renosa.

\*

It was late at night. As usual, Helmut was training.

He had informed the instructor that he was stepping out for some training.

The rule against acting alone didn’t apply to Helmut. His skills were well known among the instructors.

Helmut was someone who might endanger others but wouldn’t be endangered by anyone.

Instructor Patricia had only given a word of caution.

“Don’t go too far.”

As he was swinging his sword, his bracelet lit up.

Helmut knew it was a call from Alea.

He infused the bracelet with Vis, and a small image of Alea’s face appeared before him.

Her silver hair was illuminated clearly. It was Alea’s room.

She was sitting at her desk, her hair down.

The image was so vivid it felt like she was right in front of him.

“Hello.”

She smiled brightly and asked about his day.

Helmut hesitated briefly. He had said he wouldn’t tell Charlotte.

But what if Alea was curious about their conversation?

Fortunately, Alea was more interested in another matter.

“So, you’re going to duel?”

“He suggested it.”

“Good. Crush him.”

Alea said cheerfully and then added.

“Oh, but be careful. He’s from a Marquess family in the empire. If you handle it like in the first semester, it might become troublesome for you.”

“It will be a supervised duel.”

“And you talked with Charlotte?”

Alea’s focus returned to that.

Fortunately, perhaps because Helmut had mentioned the conversation with Instructor Petrishia in the carriage, Alea didn’t seem too concerned.

“If you’re curious about Charlotte, shall I look into it? I can find out which family she’s from in a day.”

Alea laughed.

She had connections with the dean. Though the dean wouldn’t tell her everything, Alea could subtly find out what she wanted to know from him.



H.F.C Chapter 215 (Part 1):

`				`“No.”

Helmut firmly refused. This wasn’t the first time Alea had made a similar suggestion. Helmut had rejected it before as well.

It was a refusal he couldn’t quite explain himself. While it was obvious that acquiring information in advance was advantageous, he simply couldn’t accept it.

“Alright.”

Regardless of Helmut’s decision, Alea nodded readily.

But internally, she had different thoughts.

‘Still, I should investigate.’

She had some suspicions. Even if Helmut didn’t care, she had to be prepared. They were already in the same boat.

Alea’s voice softened suddenly.

“You must be confident that she is your family, seeing how you converse with her so casually without listening to me.”

Her tone was gentle but carried a sharp edge. Helmut paused for a moment.

“…I am confident. It’s not that I ignored your words.”

“Is that so? I’ll trust you then.”

For some reason, the way she said “I’ll trust you” sounded ominous.

“Get some rest then. See you tomorrow.”

With a cheerful voice, the connection was cut off. Helmut’s training session also came to an end, leaving him with an inexplicable feeling of unease.

Once they arrived at the village and settled into the inn, Leon hurried.

He was eager to deal with that arrogant kid. It seemed Charlotte and Helmut had become somewhat closer after their conversation by the water that day.

The sight of them occasionally chatting really grated on him.

‘There’s no way Charlotte would end up with a commoner.’

A commoner capable of rising in status could marry a noble.

But that was only a story for lower nobles. Nobles recognize each other.

In Leon’s eyes, Charlot was not of a status to end up with some commoner.

She wasn’t the type to play with fire either, so it wouldn’t progress any further. He knew that in his head. But his heart felt grated.

Leon went straight to Instructor Alan.

“Instructor, I have something to discuss.”

“What is it?”

“We still have a long journey to Renosa. I would like to duel.”

Instructor Alan immediately understood his intent.

“You want to duel with Helmut?”

“Yes, that’s right. He has excellent skills. This dueling will be beneficial for both of us.”

Instructor Alan hesitated.

Not for any other reason. Leon couldn’t defeat Helmut. If he lost in front of everyone, Leon’s self-esteem would take a hit.

He was the top student representative of Greta Academy. Instructor Alan knew he was superior to Nils.

‘If Leon takes a hit, will he easily recover?’

As a third-year top student, losing to Helmut and losing confidence could lead to him losing to Charlotte, who was less skilled than him.

Losing confidence in one’s skills immediately reflects in their swordsmanship.

If the representative of Greta Academy became demoralized and was eliminated early in the upcoming swordsmanship competition, it would be problematic.

However, he couldn’t just refuse the formal request for a dueling match.

Instructor Alan furrowed his brows.

“Please allow us to duel with real swords?”

Leon’s voice carried blatant hostility. He didn’t intend to kill him by accident. He didn’t want to fall out of favor with the instructor. However, to make an impression, real swords would be more effective.

Instructor Alan soon nodded.

“Alright. If it’s under the supervision of an instructor at an appropriate place.”

“It certainly will be.”

Helmut agreed, and soon a place was arranged. Helmut and Leon stood facing each other in an open area.

Inns often housed mercenaries, so larger inns usually had training grounds or similar open spaces.

Leon felt an indescribable sensation as he looked into Helmut’s jet-black eyes.

Until being led to this place, Helmut had been quiet.

Leon had expected him to be afraid, but Helmut’s calm reaction was unexpected.

‘What’s going on? Why is this brat so calm?’

Beyond the feeling that Helmut wouldn’t be easy to defeat, Leon belatedly felt an inexplicable unease.

However, Leon quickly shook off that unease. His pride wouldn’t allow him to back down here.

Leon’s sword had never betrayed him. He had hardly ever lost to his peers. Victory was a habit for him.

‘I will win this time as well.’

And he would make that unpleasant guy kneel, as befits the representative of Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department.

‘As expected… the outcome is obvious. It can’t be helped.’

Wondering if the duel would be meaningful, Instructor Patricia crossed her arms and asked.

“Shall Charlotte and Nils duel as well?”

“It would be an honor if given the chance.”

Charlotte replied stiffly. Nils shook his head.

“The size difference is too large, so it won’t help either of us prepare for the tournament.”

Nils looked troubled. Charlotte was a petite girl, not even half Nils’ size.

Although tall and well-built for her age, in the swordsmanship department she would be considered tiny.

From Nils’ perspective, being strong and healthy, he was worried he might accidentally hurt her.

Charlotte insisted firmly.

“Still, I request it.”

“Well, if Charlot requests it, let’s give it a try.”

“Then, I would like to watch Helmut and Leon’s duel first.”

Nils reluctantly agreed.



H.F.C Chapter 215 (Part 2):

`				`Everyone’s eyes turned to Helmut and Leon standing face-to-face.

Neither had drawn their swords yet. Helmut brought his hand to his waist.

The sword hilt fit perfectly into his hand. He had already wielded this sword countless times, cutting down enemies.

For Helmut, not cutting properly with a real sword was more unusual.

“You may use Vis, but do not exceed its use beyond physical enhancement.”

Instructor Alan set detailed conditions. Both nodded.

“Understood.”

‘Let’s get started.’

Leon grasped his sword and twitched his fingertips. An inexplicable sense of urgency surged.

Meanwhile, Helmut remained composed. He wasn’t interested in what Leon was thinking.

The outcome was already determined.

Helmut took a deep breath. Instructor Alan raised his hand to signal the start.

“Begin!”

At the shout, his hand came down sharply.

Simultaneously, Helmut moved. His movement was so smooth, it was as if he was not hindered by air resistance.

Leon’s sword was drawn too. But his sword did nothing.

Whoosh! A sharp sound and a flash of light appeared before his eyes.

Light first, sound second.

A white trajectory cut through the air. Leon saw the trajectory.

But by the time he recognized it, everything was over. It was as if an invisible light had pierced through his entire body.

His vision was blocked. By a very thin, sharp light.

Leon realized what had stopped in front of him. It was the tip of a sword emitting a sharp light.

A sword stopped just a hair’s breadth away from his eyes! As if it could pierce them at any moment!

Leon’s sword couldn’t even move toward the air.

His mouth froze. His legs trembled. A momentary fear engulfed him. A murderous intent that triggered it.

The gates of death had opened their jaws right before him. Leon realized it.

‘He really intended to kill me.’

The killing intent was that of an unfeeling sword. A sword has no heart. Helmut’s killing intent contained no hesitation.

The only reason he stopped was because it was against the rules to kill.

And because the instructors were watching.

His body was covered in goosebumps. It was as if he had witnessed the true nature of someone who had committed countless murders, seeing his inhuman coldness.

Although Leon was the top fourth-year student in the swordsmanship department of Greta Academy, he lacked real combat experience.

The killing intent that could be found only in battlefield knights overwhelmed him in an instant.

‘Wh…What kind of guy is he?!’

It felt like he had touched something he shouldn’t have.

It was as if he had glimpsed the fangs of a beast hidden in a human face.

Looking at Leon’s pale face, Helmut asked expressionlessly.

“Shall we go again?”

But there was no answer.

“Let’s do it one more time.”

Helmut changed his tone. He slightly regretted it.

It ended too quickly.

His goal was to make him covered in wounds. What he did wasn’t enough as a threat.

Unconsciously, he had completely immersed himself and drawn his sword. He hadn’t intended to show that he could finish someone like Leon with a single strike.

The sword drawn with full power stopped just before piercing him.

Stopping was more surprising. Helmut had allowed his murderous instinct to take over.

He didn’t consider the instructors or professors watching at all.

Immersion in the sword invites killing. Helmut knew that was the latent savagery within him.

He couldn’t definitively say it was the influence of the Seed of Darkness.

However, a tiny bit of consciousness had stopped him. Helmut let out a sigh of relief.

‘Have I become human enough to control my instincts?’

If so, that’s fortunate. Perhaps because he was holding a real sword. He had been so immersed that he had lost control momentarily.

His intense and combat-driven real-life experience had pulled him in.

It was as if it had already become a part of him. To eliminate the enemy most efficiently and quickly. Thus, leading to uncontrollable directions.

“We should stop here.”

Instructor Alan intervened. Leon, his face pale, stormed off the field.

Unable to bear the humiliation that hit him late.

Professor Luxen, standing beside, tilted his head.

‘Something is strange. That boy.’

His exam papers were impressive. That’s why he had taken notice of him.

But aside from that, something felt different about him from other boys.

It was as if some part of him, as a human, was missing.

And because of that, some other aspect was sharply honed.

‘Extraordinary talent sometimes makes a person inhuman. But…’

There was something peculiar about Helmut. That peculiarity piqued the mage’s curiosity.

Professor Luxen’s eyes glimmered.

‘I need to keep an eye on him.’

Nils and Charlotte, who had been watching with admiration, took their positions for their turn at dueling.

Helmut loosened his nerves and sat down to one side.

Instructor Patricia approached and spoke.

“Excellent. It seems you have grown further.”

Clearly, Helmut was in a realm that Instructor Patricia couldn’t measure.

But an instructor’s eyes could see beyond realms.

Helmut nodded.

“Yes.”

“Can we expect you to win the upcoming swordsmanship tournament? Don’t hold too much against Leon. He must have realized by now.”

Why the instructors treated Helmut differently was clear. Helmut replied curtly,

“I won’t.”

No need to resent him. He was insignificant, simply weak. That’s how the weak are.

A cutting contempt seeped through his thoughts, and he felt a keen murderous intent.

He was startled. It felt strange. It was as if an invisible force was affecting him. Was it because he was heading to Renosa?

He looked down at his own hand. Strong and steady. It seemed unable to detect any anomaly.

The following duel match ended with Nils’ victory.



H.F.C Chapter 216 (Part 1):

`				`“You’re quite something, you know.”

Nils extended his hand. Charlotte took it and stood up without resistance.

The opponent was a sixth-year student. She knew it would be hard to win.

But still, the pride of a swordsman couldn’t help but feel bitter.

Charlotte was an honor student. Despite having met formidable opponents like Helmut and Asuka, she wasn’t used to losing.

She couldn’t help but ask herself the question.

‘If it were Senior Asuka, would he have lost like this?’

She didn’t need to consider Helmut; even if it were Asuka. If Asuka were here instead.

No. The answer was immediate. Asuka would not have lost to Nils. Even if the opponent was the top of the sixth year, Asuka would have prevailed.

Asuka’s presence weighed heavily on Charlotte. His swordsmanship was impressive beyond mere strength.

She had never seen such an aggressive and instinctive swordsman. Charlotte knew she wouldn’t be able to shake off the thought of ‘If it were Senior Asuka’ throughout the tournament.

Because she had become the representative of the Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department in his place.

At the very least, she had to fill the void left by his absence. Charlotte was diligent to the point that she couldn’t shake off that burden.

Charlotte had also realized that Asuka had conceded it to her. But she had no interest in his true intentions.

One thing was clear: it was not desirable for her to be the representative of Greta Academy. Charlotte gritted her teeth.

“I can see you weren’t chosen as the representative for nothing. Let’s duel often in the future.”

Nils’ words were sincere.

As he dueled with Charlotte, he was inwardly impressed. He had underestimated her because she was a small girl, but as soon as the match began, he forgot that prejudice.

Charlotte’s sword was light, quick, and concealed its sharpness.

Because the opponent was small, it was even more challenging for Nils, who had a large build, to deal with her.

Thinking about the upcoming tournament, dueling with her would be very helpful.

Getting used to opponents as small and quick as Charlotte would make other opponents seem sluggish by comparison.

“Let’s do that.”

Charlotte nodded. In the future matches leading up to Renosa, she aimed to defeat Nils. Even if just once.

That was her newly formed goal.

\*

That day, Leon unexpectedly accepted it calmly. He acknowledged that he had lost and that Helmut was stronger than him.

No, he had no choice but to accept it. The death that had approached his very eyes had robbed him of his fighting spirit.

Helmut had etched the fear of death into him.

After that, Leon, who had become remarkably quiet, started avoiding Helmut.

Since they traveled in separate carriages anyway, avoiding him wasn’t difficult. It was the first complete defeat he had ever faced against someone his age.

A beaten dog doesn’t dare to bark. Especially not in the swordsmanship department.

‘Maybe because he has some skill, he understands his place quickly.’

Helmut felt a slight disappointment. The journey to Renosa was smooth.

So smooth that it felt almost boring.

Traveling with the Greta Academy faculty, there could have been a blind bandit attacking the carriage emblazoned with the Greta Academy crest, but fortunately or unfortunately, that didn’t happen.

Except for Leon, the others chatted quite a bit.

Helmut also exchanged a few words with Nils, thanks to Charlotte being a bridge.

Nils, having seen Helmut’s skills, was strangely respectful towards him.

The hierarchical relationship based on school years was already meaningless. Naturally, Helmut was placed at the top of the hierarchy, excluding the faculty.

Helmut felt just one discomfort.

‘Professor Luxen… he’s a bit irritating.’

Luxen kept trying to talk to him and follow him during training.

If it had been a female professor, one might suspect romantic interest. Luxen’s blatant interest in Helmut was obvious to anyone.

Of course, even for a male professor, one might wonder if he had some peculiar taste. Helmut was undeniably a handsome boy.

More than anything, it was annoying when he tried to converse with Alea.

If this side doesn’t respond, communication cannot be established even if Alea attempts it.

Because of Professor Luxen, Helmut had to reject Alea’s communication several times.

Fortunately, after Helmut outright said that he was being a nuisance, Luxen stopped following him at least during training.

Alea, hearing the story, simply commented.

“Professor Luxen doesn’t have those kinds of inclinations.”

That was all he needed to hear. Alea then gave him some vague warning.

“Be careful. My bracelet can conceal it, but still.”

The existence of the Seed of Darkness must not be revealed. That was the message.

Anyway, the carriage continued to trundle along. The Greta Academy group finally reached Renosa.



H.F.C Chapter 216 (Part 2):

`				`“It’s fortunate we arrived at our destination without any accidents.”

The road widened further. As they got closer to the Principality of Renosa, Instructor Alan, who had been leading the students on the journey, spoke with relief.

Despite his furrowed brows, there was a hint of relief in his eyes.

He was the person in charge of this group. Once they entered Renosa, they would be under the management of the tournament organizers. His job would become slightly easier.

Most of the Greta Academy students were of noble birth. The journey was prepared to match that standard.

Though it wasn’t luxurious, it was made sure to be comfortable. It wasn’t a task Alan was familiar with.

“We’ll be able to rest once we arrive.”

Instructor Patricia, who had maintained her poise until now, winked and touched his shoulder.

Instructor Alan looked at her with gentle eyes.

In any case, it was thanks to the dean’s consideration that the two of them were traveling together.

Professor Luxen coughed for no apparent reason.

“Ahem! it seems there’s something up ahead.”

He pointed ahead, having scanned the area with a short-range detection spell.

Indeed, there was something ahead. No hostility was felt.

The group was nearing Renosa’s territory. It was likely that those who had come to greet them had received advance notice.

Having sent word that they would arrive today, it was likely they had come to meet them.

The group approached with caution, prepared for any eventuality.

Soon, the figures came into view. They were well-trained elite soldiers.

Lined up along the roadside, they were motionless and exuded a stifling military discipline.

They gave off the impression of swords honed solely for cutting down enemies. Each one was highly skilled.

Black armor. Emblazoned with wings and a sword. The moment they saw them, everyone except Helmut knew who they were.

“The Black Wing Knights of Renosa?”

“They’re here… this is too much just to greet us.”

Nils murmured. Helmut recalled what he knew about the Black Wing Knights of Renosa.

Among the many pieces of information he had gathered, there was information about the Black Wing Knights.

They were one of the few knight orders that could be said to be on par with the Palma Knights of Basor.

While less rough and more refined than the Palma Knights, their skill was comparable.

In one-on-one combat, they might even be better than the Palma Knights.

Renosa had almost no demonic beasts, and these knights fought humans.

Even though Renosa was putting a lot of effort into this swordsmanship tournament, having the Grand Duke’s direct Black Wing Knights to greet the Greta Academy members was excessive.

They likely didn’t greet all the academy groups this way.

Was it a coincidence?

Charlotte’s face noticeably hardened upon seeing them.

‘Why are the Black Wing Knights here… could it be His Highness the Grand Duke?’

As the carriage reached the impressive presence of the knights, one of the Black Wing Knights stepped forward.

With a loud neigh, the carriage came to a halt.

A calm voice rang out.

“We received word that you would be passing through here today. Welcome, members of Greta Academy. I am Karl Vanto of the Black Wing Knights.”

It wasn’t a situation typically warranting the appearance of the Knights’ Commander or Deputy Commander.

But it was clear from his demeanor that he was of considerable rank.

“What brings you out here?”

It wasn’t a greeting for dignitaries. The members of Greta Academy knew they weren’t considered dignitaries.

There were more than just one or two Black Wing Knights. There were dozens of them.

“We are here to escort you to your destination. This is the will of the Grand Duchy of Renosa.”

Charlotte knew who the man in front of her was. She detected subtlety in his words.

He didn’t say it was the will of His Highness the Grand Duke. That meant…

In any case, he did not greet Charlotte directly.

‘Not yet…’

Charlotte closed her eyes slowly, then opened them. She knew there was a high chance she would be revealed despite the academy’s policy.

The faculty also knew who Charlotte was.

But Charlotte felt relieved that it wouldn’t happen immediately. She did not want to reveal her identity. She fervently wished not to.

Maybe it was because she enjoyed the time she spent with the Greta Academy members.

At Greta Academy, Charlotte could just be Charlotte.

A diligent and talented student, liked by everyone. Not a worthless being hated by her brother and ignored by her mother. She didn’t want to destroy that.

Instructor Alan guessed why they had come this far.

“We appreciate the generous treatment. We take it as encouragement to achieve excellent results.”

“And there is one other matter to address.”

His tone suggested it was not so much a request as a statement of something that must obviously be done, almost like a command.

Karl Vanto shifted his gaze to Charlotte.

“The Grand Duchy of Renosa wishes to meet with Miss Charlotte.”

His expression and tone were respectful.

“Would you accompany us?”

Everyone turned to look at Charlotte. Her complexion wavered as if she had been counterattacked.

She knew who wanted to see her.

She hadn’t expected Michael to be able to move the Grand Duke’s direct Black Wing Knights.

‘Is he trying to show me that he has control over the Black Wing Knights?’

The Grand Duke wasn’t a puppet, so it wouldn’t be complete control.

But it was clear Michael had been granted such authority.

Karl Vanto asked Charlotte again, his tone slightly troubled.

“Would you come with us?”

It was an invitation to Charlotte, not a demand to the Greta Academy faculty.

Karl Vanto didn’t bow or lower himself. It wasn’t a request for consent.

His attitude was subtly high-handed. Slightly unpleasant.

But the faculty didn’t point it out.

They were dealing with the Black Wing Knights of Renosa. There was nothing to gain by clashing with them here. They were here to compete.

“It would be difficult for her to act alone, but since Charlotte’s hometown is Renosa, it shouldn’t be a problem.”

In a tone that seemed to grant permission, Instructor Patricia stepped back.

Instructor Alan agreed. But he added one condition.

“Charlotte, what do you think?”

“I want to go.”

There was no intention to avoid it. She would face it.

Determination filled Charlotte’s eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 217 (Part 1):

`				`“If that’s what you wish.”

Instructor Alan replied with a cautious expression. Just because the other person was the Grand Princess of Renosa and they were in Renosa didn’t mean the situation would change immediately.

Charlotte was still a student of Greta Academy. He treated her as such, which was also what Charlotte wanted.

“However, even though we are in Renosa, we can’t allow you to act alone for long, so please return to the accommodation by at least tomorrow.”

Instructor Patricia added to Instructor Alan’s request.

“Will you be able to do that?”

“Of course.”

Karl Vanto answered calmly.

“Then.”

Charlotte slightly bowed her head to the faculty.

Professor Luxen stroked his chin as he looked at her, and Instructor Patricia had a troubled expression.

This was the first time they had encountered such a situation.

Visiting a student’s country and having a knight order take the student away!

Of course, there would be no issue with safety. It was a situation difficult to refuse.

There was a brief murmuring among the group.

Leon and Nils looked at each other. Confusion was evident on their faces.

Helmut observed the situation silently. It wasn’t that he wasn’t curious. But it seemed he would soon find out.

Karl Vanto, raising his eyebrows, concluded cleanly.

“Then, Miss Charlotte, please follow me. The rest of you will be safely escorted by the Black Wing Knights.”

The Greta Academy group thus joined the Black Wing Knights. Charlotte, however, followed Karl Vanto to the prepared carriage.

Karl Vanto’s attitude changed once they were sufficiently distanced from the Greta Academy group.

As Charlotte boarded the carriage, Karl Vanto bowed his head to her. It was a knightly salute.

“Please forgive my rudeness, Your Highness.”

“No, thank you for following the academy’s policies. So, is Michael looking for me?”

Even with the Black Wing Knights coming, she didn’t think the Grand Duke would be looking for her.

If it were the Grand Duke, he would formally invite her instead of arranging such a troublesome meeting. Even if he was Charlotte’s father.

Karl Vanto wasn’t familiar to Charlotte either.

However, the Black Wing Knights themselves were not unfamiliar to her.

Not because she was the Grand Princess of Renosa, but because she had been taught swordsmanship by the commander of the Black Wing Knights.

Michael had intensely envied that fact. Because even swinging a sword for an hour left him bedridden the next day due to his weak body.

Moreover, his talent for swordsmanship was mediocre.

Even though they were born on the same day, their talents in swordsmanship couldn’t even be compared.

Karl Vanto nodded.

“Yes, he wishes to see you as soon as possible. Therefore, we came to welcome the Greta Academy group under that pretext.”

Charlotte asked for confirmation.

“Does Michael have the authority to move the Black Wing Knights?”

“After returning from Basor, at the request of the Grand Duchess, he was allowed to accompany some of us. However, the personnel here moved under a specific pretext.”

“So, my mother… did that.”

Even the Grand Duke could not ignore the words of the Grand Duchess. The simplest way for Michael to get what he wanted was through his mother.

Without hesitation, their mother had given many things to her frail young son, disregarding Charlotte’s presence.

As if she had only one child. As if the heir’s position naturally belonged to Michael.

It left a bitter taste in her mouth. It was a familiar yet never fully acceptable fact.

With a firm expression, Charlotte left one request.

“Treat my group the same as the other academy representatives. Don’t think of giving them special treatment just because I’m here. This is a fair competition.”

It was a straightforward request. She herself felt uncomfortable about being separated alone to meet Michael.

No matter how much this was Renosa and the semester was ending, Charlotte was still part of Greta Academy.

“Understood, Your Highness.”

Karl Vanto responded calmly. Charlotte, without saying another word, got into the carriage.

She planned to rejoin her group after her business was done.



H.F.C Chapter 217 (Part 2):

`				`After a brief journey, the carriage stopped in front of an elegant mansion on the outskirts of a village.

Charlotte recognized the place.

It was a villa of the Grand Duchy of Renosa.

Even though she had prepared herself, as she was led inside, she felt an inexplicable tension. A maid guided her.

“This way. Prince Michael has prepared a meal.”

She was indeed hungry. Although she doubted she could eat with Michael in front of her.

Creak.

As the door opened, her eyes brightened. A delicious aroma quickly filled her nostrils. At the same time, a voice greeted her.

“Welcome, Charlotte. It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”

A friendly and soft voice echoed. Charlotte stiffened as she looked at him.

With the sunlight pouring through the window behind him, Michael sat at a marble table, his chin resting on his hand, looking angelic.

The smile on the face of the blond boy with lake-like blue eyes was as if drawn.

Charlotte responded calmly.

“It’s been a while, Michael.”

“Have a seat. I’ve prepared your favorite dishes.”

The meal, centered around light and clean seafood dishes, matched her taste surprisingly well after the first bite.

Receiving such treatment, it would be hard for anyone not to fall for him.

Michael knew Charlotte’s preferences and habits meticulously, even though he disliked her.

It was his nature. Observing people, distinguishing likes and dislikes, and trying to win and use their hearts.

Michael had never tried to win Charlotte’s heart. If he had wanted to, it wouldn’t have been impossible.

“Why did you call me?”

Charlotte asked in a flat tone. She couldn’t tell from the letter, but being here made it clear.

This was an omen of malice. Michael always acted overly friendly before revealing his malice.

She didn’t feel particularly disappointed anew.

Charlotte remained composed, and Michael’s smile deepened as he watched her.

“I wanted to show some consideration for my sister, who must have been having messy meals at inns on her way back to Renosa. Please, go ahead and eat.”

Charlotte ate. She didn’t storm out because she knew that would lead to more trouble.

If Michael was trying to tame her.

Charlotte was a member of the Grand Duchy of Renosa. She couldn’t live ignoring him forever. In a way, he was someone Charlotte had to endure.

As Michael watched Charlotte eat, without lifting a finger himself, he asked nonchalantly.

“How is life at the academy?”

Wouldn’t he feel bitter if she said she was doing well? After all, it was something Michael could only dream of.

But Charlotte didn’t lie.

“It’s going well.”

“I heard you’re the top first-year in the swordsmanship department. Seeing that you’ve come to Renosa as part of the Greta Academy group, you must be doing well. It seems your skills are recognized at the academy. But…”

Michael made an insinuating remark.

“It’s a bit strange that you became one of Gretna Academy’s selectees. Apparently the originally selected person had to give it up? Your resourcefulness is impressive.”

At the subtle insinuation, Charlotte put on a stern expression.

“It’s not about my resourcefulness. It was that person’s choice.”

“Can you confidently say you did nothing to influence that choice?”

Michael was suggesting that Asuka gave up for Charlotte’s sake, and Charlotte intended that.

He liked to attach causes to the results of everything. Especially misinterpreting Charlotte’s intentions.

“Instead of this kind of talk, just tell me what you really want to say. Why did you call me out like this? You could have quietly summoned me.”

“Now I see why you’re upset. You don’t want them to know you’re the Grand Princess of Renosa? Do you like life at the academy that much?”

Michael laughed. Charlotte stood up abruptly.

But she wasn’t good at verbal jabs or sarcasm. Instead, she had become more decisive.

Not seeing Michael for a while had been good medicine. Charlotte spoke firmly.

“I’m glad to see you’re doing well. I’m leaving now.”

As she tried to leave, Michael’s tone changed.

“Sit down.”

It was a high-handed tone. Michael didn’t speak to anyone else that way. Except for Charlotte.

“Unless you want me to tell them that you are the Grand Princess of Renosa.”

“They’ll find out eventually.”

“They might not. If you finish your meal and return, I’ll keep it a secret. Until your group leaves Renosa, they won’t know.”

“It doesn’t matter if they find out.”

“Do you think the only harm I can cause you is just that?”

Michael opened his eyes wide as if in disbelief.

The swordsmanship tournament was hosted in Renosa. Subtly disadvantaging the Greta Academy wouldn’t be difficult.

In fact, it had always been so in previous comprehensive swordsmanship tournaments.

That’s why Basor’s martial arts tournament, where everything was fair, was famous.

Charlotte clenched her fist.

She was surprised at herself for wanting to hit him.

There were guards, but it would only take a moment for Charlotte to take Michael down.

Michael wouldn’t be able to resist. Yet he sat there without any protection.

As if knowing Charlotte wouldn’t do that. His confidence was unsettling.

Michael changed his tone quickly.

“I want to hear something from you.”

Charlotte asked while still standing.

“What do you want to hear?”

Michael smiled naturally.

“About the selected students of Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department? I heard there are some interesting stories from Greta Academy.”

“They are all excellent. I am the least skilled among the selected. So I want to go back and focus on training.”

Michael seemed ready to get to the main point. Words flowed smoothly from his mouth.

“Indeed. But I heard there’s a commoner among your group. It’s surprising. It’s not easy for a commoner to outperform nobles at the academy.”

He frowned slightly and asked.

“Is his name… Helmut?”

The moment Michael mentioned Helmut’s name, an eerie chill rushed over her. It wasn’t a good sign.

Charlotte tried to regain her composure.

“Yes. Senior Helmut is known as a commoner and is the top second-year in the swordsmanship department.”

Was Michael trying to recruit Helmut?

It was possible. As a commoner, he wouldn’t have a fixed allegiance, and Helmut had the talent.

The Black Wing Knights of Renosa were a haven for skilled knights and offered good treatment.

No matter how much Charlotte was against it, she couldn’t take that opportunity away from Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 218 (Part 1):

`				`‘Senior Helmut doesn’t seem like someone who would fit into the Black Wing Knights.’

For some reason, Charlotte felt that way. His presence was too intense to be confined to any organization.

Michael asked subtly.

“Who among the Greta Academy representatives has the most outstanding skills?”

But before Charlotte could answer, Michael found the answer in her brief hesitation.

“It’s Helmut, isn’t it? Amazing, especially since he’s a commoner. He’s more skilled than even the senior students? And he’s gained your favor.”

Michael’s eyes gleamed with a peculiar light. Charlotte felt a stirring unease.

Now that she thought about it, Helmut knew her mother’s maiden name. She didn’t know how that fact might connect with Michael, but it felt uncomfortable.

She had a premonition that these two should not be connected in any way.

“Could it be you’re interested in him as a man? The commoner, I mean.”

“No.”

Charlotte cut him off firmly. Even though nobles and commoners were treated equally within the academy, that wasn’t the case outside of it.

For the Grand Princess of Renosa to harbor feelings for a commoner would be an inability to understand her position.

Even Michael, who hopes Charlotte lowers herself, would not accept such a thing.

“He’s a diligent and skilled senior. If you want to recruit him, do as you wish. Senior Helmut is impeccable as a knight.”

Charlotte answered as fairly as possible. She didn’t want Michael to hold any ill will against Helmut because of her.

For a commoner like Helmut, the enmity of Renosa’s heir would be too much to handle.

But she soon realized that describing Helmut as an impeccable knight did not quite fit him.

Charlotte had heard how Helmut dealt with a second-year student who had provoked him.

From what she could see, Helmut was not the type to be docile or obedient to anyone.

He should not be involved with someone like Michael. Michael was the type to get what he wanted, which meant they were bound to clash.

Michael shrugged lightly.

“Well, talent isn’t exclusive to Greta Academy. I’ll keep your words in mind.”

Charlotte added firmly.

“Even if His Highness granted you rights over the Black Wing Knights, it’s meant to protect you. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t flaunt it like this.”

Sending the Black Wing Knights was a way for Michael to show off the authority he had gained as an heir.

But the name of the Black Wing Knights was too significant to be used for such purposes.

Also, this way of doing things that she couldn’t refuse was unpleasant.

The mere act of the Black Wing Knights coming en masse to take Charlotte could make others suspicious of her identity.

Though the faculty already knew, it would be difficult to dispel the doubts of the other selected students.

Even though Michael promised to keep it secret, he didn’t guarantee it unconditionally.

Michael’s lips curled into a smile. A cold smile that only Charlotte could see, despite his angelic face.

“That’s my right. Something you don’t have. And I will gain even more in the future. Things you won’t be able to have.”

“Whatever you gain has nothing to do with me.”

“It does have to do with you. By the time you graduate from Greta Academy, you will be kneeling at my feet as a vassal of Renosa.”

Michael was openly wary of other heirs of Renosa.

If he was saying this to establish hierarchy, it meant he wasn’t yet intent on eliminating Charlotte.

If he wanted to eliminate her, it would be better to win her over and make her lower her guard.

But Charlotte never forgot that Michael could turn on her at any moment.

“If you can, do so. By fair means.”

She couldn’t help but dislike his methods, which involved even using their mother.

Sometimes, weakness can be a weapon. Michael knew how to use that well.

Yet, he also had the talent to win everyone’s favor.

That was his greatest talent, surpassing Charlotte’s talent with the sword.

Charlotte’s meal had ended at some point. Michael, who hadn’t touched his food, changed his smile.

He looked at Charlotte with an unreadable expression and spoke.

“I’m glad to see you’re the same as ever. Let’s meet again.”

He waved lightly. As Charlotte stood up, she left a parting remark.

“You haven’t changed either.”

She had no choice but to act as Michael intended once she came this far.

Even though she had tried to remain composed, she couldn’t help but feel emotional.

‘I hope senior Helmut won’t get into trouble because of…this.’

Charlotte hoped Michael wouldn’t take an interest in him.

Michael would be busy. Successfully hosting the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament in Renosa was his task.

At least he wouldn’t cause immediate trouble, which was fortunate.



H.F.C Chapter 218 (Part 2):

`				`“Cinus.”

As soon as Charlotte left, Michael called out.

Cinus appeared like a shadow and stood before Michael.

“Yes, Your Highness.”

“What did you think of Charlotte?”

“She seems unchanged.”

“Right? I thought so too. Good.”

Michael smiled. Unlike the smile he showed Charlotte, this one gave a pure impression.

Of course, purity wasn’t a word that suited Michael.

He tapped his forehead and fell into deep thought.

Charlotte has not changed. Her unambitious nature remains the same.

Despite attending the academy, she hadn’t developed any new ambitions. He had worried about that.

Michael only had one kind of ambition to be wary of: ambition for the position of Renosa’s heir.

Observing Charlotte was important to Michael. She was the only competitor who could take what he had.

Michael was more wary of her than Charlotte realized.

Without Michael, who would oppose Charlotte becoming the heir of Renosa?

She had everything Michael lacked: health, a proper character, and excellent swordsmanship.

Especially the first, which was why the Grand Duke hadn’t readily handed over all authority to Michael.

There was always doubt whether he was sturdy enough to uphold Renosa.

‘Even if I’ve gotten better, I’ll never be healthy enough to wield a sword.’

He still fell ill at least one day a week. But Michael was certain.

‘Even so, Charlotte won’t be able to beat me.’

Michael was superior in securing what he wanted.

Charlotte wasn’t even aiming for the heir’s position. She would accept it only if it were given to her.

As long as Charlotte didn’t confront him or defy their mother, the heir’s position was his.

Michael had to continuously remind her of this. He would be the master of Renosa, and Charlotte would have to support him.

Michael did feel jealousy towards Charlotte, but he also considered her family.

They were twins. His only sister. The bond from birth couldn’t be ignored.

Michael’s actions were always calculated. Although his actions towards Charlotte sometimes lacked calculation, even those emotional actions and words were because Charlotte was special.

Michael never forgot that if Charlotte were an ally, she would be the most reliable sword.

The most trustworthy loyal sword. She would be a good knight.

Michael finished his thoughts and asked.

“How did the investigations go? Cinus.”

“Here is the list of selected students from each academy.”

Michael received the thick documents Cinus handed over. The documents did not contain appearances.

It was impressive to gather this much. Baden’s academies were particularly strict about protecting student information.

After flipping through the documents for a while, Michael wore a bored expression and asked.

“Is he among them? Hyde.”

“He’s skilled enough to be selected. But there’s no one named Hyde on the list.”

“He participated in Basor’s martial arts tournament for a purpose. So he might not participate in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, even if he’s skilled. He’s hiding his skills.”

“He’s too skilled to be learning at an academy.”

The voice was laced with doubt. If he was the winner of Basor’s martial arts tournament, he should be teaching, not learning.

He must have a purpose for attending the academy, likely to hide himself.

“But he’s attending an academy. And he must be standing out to some extent.”

He must be achieving excellent results. Michael felt Hyde wouldn’t tolerate being at the bottom, even if he hid his skills.

Could a commoner be that stubborn? He must be a noble.

That was Michael’s judgment.

He thought Hyde was attending an academy in Baden, but he ordered a thorough search of all academies just in case.

Cinus reported his findings.

“Based on what I’ve found, there’s no one named Hyde resembling him across all academies.”

“Of course. He must be using an alias. And perhaps a disguise…”

Michael tried to recall Hyde’s appearance. Once Michael decided to pursue something, he didn’t let go easily.

He had diligently pursued Hyde, despite Hyde leaving almost no trace. There had just been some challenges along the way.

Michael pondered and nodded.

“He must have used a disguise to vanish so cleanly.”

With such a noticeable appearance, it wouldn’t be easy to evade tracking unless he looked completely different.

“He used an artifact. Most likely one that changes appearance.”

“Right, so the question is whether he’s participating in this comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.”

Michael raised an eyebrow.

“If I see his sword, I’ll recognize him, no matter what he looks like.”

It was the swordsmanship of the Sword Saint Darien. He had already eliminated one person because of it. The only question was whether Hyde had brought that sword with him.

“He wouldn’t know you’re here. So he might not avoid the tournament.”

“Right? I hope so.”

Michael’s eyes narrowed.

“More than that, this commoner Helmut…”



H.F.C Chapter 219 (Part 1):

`				`“We don’t have much information on him. Black hair, black eyes, a cold and aloof demeanor. He transferred in as a second-year student and took the top spot. He’s a boy who receives the support of an instructor and is quite respected at Greta Academy.

Nothing is known about his past before entering the academy. It’s also unknown who taught him the sword. The most notable thing is that he’s very handsome.”

At that moment, the name that flashed through Michael’s mind was Hyde.

Hyde was also very handsome. With such looks, it would be no wonder he would cause a stir both inside and outside the academy. Unless he was in disguise.

Michael shook his head.

‘Helmut is a commoner.’

His judgment wouldn’t be wrong.

Hyde was too dignified to be a commoner. A commoner couldn’t possess such a character.

No matter how strong they are, a commoner must learn to obey nobles from birth throughout their life.

The consciousness cultivated from a young age is not easily overcome.

Hyde maintained his dignified attitude even though he knew Michael was no ordinary noble.

“Charlotte has quite a picky personality. She’s upright and can’t tolerate anything unjust or unreasonable. If she acknowledges him, it’s worth paying attention to.”

They were fellow students at the same academy. Although there was a difference in grade, they could be quite close.

Would Helmut then become Charlotte’s weakness? Michael quickly thought it through.

Perhaps he could be. Even if it’s not a romantic feeling, Charlotte would never tolerate someone from the same academy getting hurt because of her.

But there’s no need to provoke Charlotte like that yet.

He didn’t want to make Charlotte draw her sword.

Michael concluded simply.

“Would you like to visit the Greta Academy group? If you wish, I can arrange a meeting.”

“I am the one hosting the tournament in Renosa. If that becomes known, the fairness of the tournament could be questioned, so I cannot do that. Let me make it clear, I have no intention of watching from afar either. I am not that idle. I will see Helmut at the tournament. There’s still plenty of time.”

Michael smiled, thinking about the upcoming stage.

It was a task entrusted to him by the Grand Duke. It was a test as a successor.

Michael received the rights to the Black Wing Knights not only because of his mother’s request but also because he was hosting the tournament.

He doesn’t expect Charlotte, a mere first-year student, to show anything remarkable in the swordsmanship tournament.

He only needed to perform the task given by the Grand Duke admirably. That was to successfully host the swordsmanship tournament.

‘I have an inexplicable premonition.’

But that premonition would surely work to his advantage. Michael was confident.

\*

Although they had not yet reached the capital of Renosa, the Greta Academy group arrived at a luxurious mansion.

The mansion was as splendid as that of a grand noble, from the chandeliers to the wallpaper and furniture, all of which were things only the owner of an exceptional mansion would cherish.

Renosa was a wealthy nation. Such treatment would not burden them.

However, considering that their guests were not a delegation but the Greta Academy group coming for the tournament, it was somewhat excessive.

Most of the group, who were nobles, accepted the luxury without burden but recognized the excess.

“Everyone, take a rest!”

After the faculty left, only the students remained.

“It’s a luxury hard to enjoy at Greta Academy.”

Before entering the room, Nils murmured. Helmut was the only one he could talk to.

Charlotte hadn’t returned yet, and Leon had been silent since his duel with Helmut, leaving quickly as soon as the faculty left, as if it was dangerous to be alone with Helmut without the faculty.

“Yeah.”

Helmut answered indifferently. He thought the interior of the mansion was somewhat dazzling.

The Ethan Kudrow mansion was not shabby, but the splendor here was unusual.

Especially the furniture decorated with gold leaf and jewels. The rooms seen through the open doors were similarly splendid.

“Maybe it’s because of Charlotte? Upon arrival, they’ll receive similar treatment to the others, but this mansion… this is not provided to everyone.

I don’t know if it’s the original treatment for participants in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, but there wouldn’t be many mansions like this. No matter how wealthy Renosa is.”

It was unlikely this lodging was prepared as compensation for taking Greta Academy students away.

They could rest in such a mansion thanks to Charlotte. Because they were Charlotte’s group. They couldn’t give special treatment only to Charlotte.

This place was said to be the villa of the Grand Duke of Renosa.

“If the Grand Duke lends his villa, what kind of person is Charlotte?”

“Who knows.”

He had his guesses. But he wasn’t sure.



H.F.C Chapter 219 (Part 2):

`				`Nils continued speaking persistently.

“She seems to be close to you. You must have encountered her a lot since the first and second-years sometimes sparred together. Haven’t you heard anything?”

“Charlotte strictly adheres to the academy’s policy.”

“So she hasn’t revealed her status?”

“All I know is that she is from Renosa.”

“A simple noble girl from Renosa wouldn’t be sought out by the Grand Duke’s Black Wing Knights. The one she meets must at least be a member of the Grand Duke’s family. A direct descendant of the Grand Duke, or maybe even the Grand Duke himself. It would take that much to mobilize the Black Wing Knights.”

“I suppose so.”

“Why does the Grand Duke’s family want to see Charlotte? How old is the Grand Duke’s heir? I heard he’s around her age.”

Nils had vaguely heard rumors about Michael.

He was said to be very intelligent and beautiful but frail, the heir of Renosa.

Nils suddenly had a wild guess.

‘Could Charlotte be the fiancée of the Grand Duke’s heir?’

If so, such privileges wouldn’t be strange. The Renosa family is also famous for swordsmanship.

Having a prestigious knightly order like the Black Wing Knights means they value martial prowess.

A noble girl as talented as Charlotte could support the frail Grand Duke’s heir.

Helmut focused on something else.

“So there’s an heir to the Grand Duke in Renosa.”

If it was known that there was an heir, it would also be known if there was an heiress.

Then Charlotte is not the Grand Duke’s heiress. It was a bit confusing.

Helmut had thought Charlotte might be the Grand Duke’s heiress.

“I think I’ve heard something like that. In fact, little is known about the Renosa Grand Duke’s family. The Renosa family is close to the royal family. They interact only with high-ranking nobles, and their births and other personal details are kept secret. Especially since Renosa is far from the Empire, even those from the Empire know little.”

Many at the academy were from the Empire. But none of them knew about Charlotte.

Information about the direct line of the Renosa Grand Duke’s family was almost secret. Even nobles from Renosa didn’t know much.

Especially since Charlotte neglected social activities, her existence was not well known.

Only Michael, who was active publicly, was somewhat known.

Most nobles interacted for social purposes.

But that also varied by noble. Even noble children often didn’t show their faces outside their families until they debuted in society as adults.

There were few chances for others to know about them unless they directly interacted with other families.

Renosa, with its royal bloodline, was an exceptionally closed family.

Renosa was a secretive duchy. They ensured that what happened inside didn’t go beyond the walls.

Michael was also frail, and his existence had only recently become known because he was expected to die young when he was younger.

“There must be some issue with the Grand Duke’s family. Since marrying an imperial consort, their activities have been unusually quiet.”

Nils, who had been frowning, quickly closed his mouth. He was conscious of a passing maid.

This was Renosa. Speaking recklessly about the Grand Duke’s family could be considered blasphemy.

Helmut listened closely to Nils talking about the Renosa Grand Duke’s family.

“Charlotte could be a collateral relative of the Grand Duke’s family. Renosa values swordsmen, so the Grand Duke could have noticed her talent. Although Asuka refused to participate and she came instead, it’s not easy for a first-year to beat a third-year and be selected as a representative.”

Nils murmured and shook his head.

“No, forget what I said. Considering the academy’s policies, if she doesn’t wish to be known, it’s best to leave it be.”

As a sixth-year, Nils showed maturity. Though curious, he believed he shouldn’t pry.

All the faculty kept silent as well.

“Alright.”

Helmut entered his room. It seemed he needed to think a bit.

Charlotte returned that evening.

It was just when they were being served a meal together.

The meal was as grand as the mansion.

Enough to soothe their travel-weary bodies. Charlotte immediately bowed as she entered the dining room.

“I apologize for acting alone.”

“There’s no need. You had permission.”

“Yes, have a seat.”

Instructor Patricia smiled warmly, in stark contrast to her attitude towards Asuka, following Instructor Alan’s lead.

Everyone had relaxed, thanks to the excellent treatment despite the high-handed attitude of the Black Wing Knights.

After all, they entered the mansion under the escort of the Black Wing Knights, a privilege only VIPs enjoyed. It could be seen positively.

“Coming to Renosa was a good decision. You can boast about it when we return.”

Instructor Patricia murmured. Charlotte, looking around, asked.

“Is the meal to your liking?”

Charlotte, who spoke like a host, quickly realized her mistake and shut her mouth.

In Renosa, she used to greet guests with her mother.

Renosa was her family’s domain. Here, she wasn’t supposed to greet academy people, which led to the slip.

The few academy peers from Renosa had been sternly warned to keep quiet about her.

Though it seemed like something had leaked.

Instructor Patricia acted nonchalantly.

The faculty knew that Charlotte was the Grand Duke’s daughter.

“Yes, it’s wonderful. To think we’d receive such lavish treatment in Renosa. Charlotte, would you join us?”

Charlotte had already eaten but nodded to join them.

She was in the swordsmanship department. She could eat more if she wanted.



H.F.C Chapter 220 (Part 1):

`				`The Grand Duke’s heir of Renosa returned, leading the Black Wing Knights.

It felt as if a storm was sweeping through Renosa’s palace. That was the presence of Michael in this place.

“Inform my mother that I have returned.”

His soft voice resonated. It was the gentle voice of a prince, kind even to his own servants.

There was no one in the palace who did not obey that gentle voice.

“Yes, Your Highness Michael.”

The maid blushed and quickly hurried inside.

Michael moved with a smile still etched on his face. Shortly after he stepped inside, a woman appeared from the other side.

She was a beautiful woman in a dress with a crown on her head. Her steps were quick yet elegant as she approached.

She was a noblewoman who seemed to have been born with the word ‘dignity’ ingrained in her entire being.

The mistress of Renosa, Grand Duchess Margret. She approached Michael with a relieved expression.

“Oh, Michael!”

She urgently embraced him with both arms as if she had found a lost child.

“You have been ill recently, and yet you’ve traveled such a long way. Are you feeling alright?”

“Yes, I’m fine. Perhaps the sunlight in Basor helped, I feel healthier.”

Michael replied with an innocent face.

“But let’s talk inside.”

Michael’s eyes swept over the servants who bowed their heads.

While there was nothing wrong with showing that the Grand Duchess and her son had a good relationship, she treated Michael excessively like a child. It was almost excessive.

Michael was young but he was to become the master of Renosa. It wasn’t good for the servants to see him as a child.

However, the fact that she treated him like a child also meant that the Grand Duchess cared deeply for Michael.

Everything had its pros and cons. And Michael knew how to handle those cons.

The Grand Duchess promptly nodded.

“Let’s do that. Would you like to have some tea? Are you not hungry?”

“I’m fine with food for now. Having tea and chatting with you after so long sounds nice.”

His voice was like a balm, and his smile was refreshing.

Michael knew that if they dined together, his mother would be anxious to feed him more, which could lead to indigestion.

The enchanted Grand Duchess entered the parlor with Michael.

The two of them enjoyed a private conversation over tea.

“So, did you meet Charlotte well?”

“Yes, she’s the same as always.”

“Did you clear up the misunderstanding? Charlotte thinks you’re avoiding her.”

She spoke with a concerned tone, as if it couldn’t possibly be true. Margret always thought positively of Michael’s every action.

This time, it was true. Even though it twisted his insides that Charlotte had entered Baden’s prestigious academy, a place he couldn’t go and where she was now out of his reach.

Michael smiled lightly.

“Of course. I welcomed Charlotte with the Black Wing Knights. It was a special courtesy to the Grand Duchess. Charlotte deserves such treatment. Although I might get scolded by the Grand Duke for it, I believe Charlotte will appreciate my sincerity.”

Michael spoke with a smile, carefully packaging his words. Though, of course, he had other intentions.

Charlotte had precisely seen through Michael’s motive for bringing the Black Wing Knights, but his mother had not.

Margret laughed happily.

“Oh, that’s wonderful. Charlotte will be pleased. It would have been even better if the commander of the Black Wing Knights went personally. He’s her mentor, after all.”

Margret was certainly not foolish. She was the Grand Duchess of Renosa. The position beside the Grand Duke, who ruled the duchy, was not one a foolish or lacking woman could hold.

But somehow, when it came to Michael, it was as if something blinded her, and her thinking rapidly narrowed.

She wouldn’t think beyond the explanation Michael had given about why he met Charlotte with the Black Wing Knights.

“Yes, but if he had moved, Greta Academy might have been suspicious.”

That was not the only reason. How could one who needed to be separated be kept close?

The commander of the Black Wing Knights subtly supported Charlotte despite her lack of interest in the heir position.

The reason was simple. Michael wasn’t a swordsman.

The commander of the Black Wing Knights was a man who could only lean toward Charlotte, who had excellent swordsmanship talent, rather than Michael, who couldn’t wield a sword.

Michael had no complaint about that. He should not. For it was the duty of Renosa’s master to handle even such people.

However, a cold light flashed in Michael’s eyes.

After a brief silence, during which Margret sipped her tea, she continued.

“Charlotte will probably come back too. She won’t be able to return to the palace until the tournament is over, so make sure she doesn’t lack anything.”

“I will do my best. Though I’m worried that her identity as the Grand Duchess might be revealed. Charlotte doesn’t want that. It’s the academy’s policy, she says.”

Charlotte wouldn’t receive any special treatment. Michael intended to leave her alone for now. It would be problematic if she achieved excellent results in the swordsmanship tournament.

Michael didn’t really mind if Charlotte’s identity as the Grand Duchess was revealed.

The faculty would know, and while the few representatives from Greta Academy might not know, even if they found out, what could they do? They would just have to keep their mouths shut.

‘If it becomes known that Charlotte is the Grand Duchess of Renosa, there will be those who flock to her. It would be troublesome if she builds forces.’

Michael briefly worried.

“Just a first-year at the academy, yet chosen as a representative to come to Renosa. It’s something I couldn’t even dream of… Charlotte is truly remarkable. I feel like she’s drifting farther away from me.”

As Michael showed a bitter expression, the Grand Duchess quickly grabbed his hand.

“Oh, Michael, you’re doing well here in Renosa. You don’t have to think like that. When Charlotte returns, she’ll be by your side.”

‘Not by my side, but beneath me.’

Michael thought leisurely as he looked at his mother.



H.F.C Chapter 220 (Part 2):

`				`“Yes, I should do well in Renosa. I must also successfully conclude this swordsmanship tournament.”

“I worry about the heavy responsibilities the Grand Duke has placed on you. I fear for your health.”

“It’s an opportunity to gain the Grand Duke’s recognition. I am the heir of Renosa. It’s my duty.”

The Grand Duke was not a father but the Grand Duke. While he called his mother ‘mother’, he never called his father ‘father’.

The Grand Duke was such an existence. Before being a father, he was the master of the duchy.

Ironically, he was a husband to Margret. If there was anyone who could move the Grand Duke, it was this beautiful noblewoman. Michael knew this well.

The stern father had no choice but to grant Michael the privilege of the Black Wing Knights due to her persuasion.

However, the Grand Duke was not easily swayed.

After listening to a few more of Margret’s worried words, Michael left the parlor and headed straight to the Grand Duke’s study.

First, to his mother, then to the Grand Duke. This was the set order.

“Please enter, Your Highness Michael.”

“I come before Your Highness, the glory of Renosa.”

Michael bowed his head as he entered the office.

The man in the room, backlit by the light, lifted his head.

The pressure was like a mountain crashing down. The gaze that fell upon him was so intense it felt like it could pierce through.

Facing those jet-black eyes, Michael lowered his head.

The Grand Duke of Renosa. With black hair and black eyes, he was still handsome and youthful enough that there was no need to recall his younger days.

His gaze and charisma were fitting for a ruler.

The Grand Duke of Renosa was known as the Iron-Blooded Grand Duke.

As soon as Michael finished his greeting, the Grand Duke spoke coldly.

“Yes, I know you cannot be a lion. But you must know that a fox cannot become the master of Renosa!”

The Grand Duke of Renosa was an exceptional swordsman. His words, filled with authority and power, often overwhelmed others.

Even Michael was no exception to feeling intimidated in his presence.

But Michael managed to smile. He knew he couldn’t show weakness in front of the Grand Duke.

“You are displeased that I mobilized the Black Wing Knights.”

“Only the master of Renosa can command the Black Wing Knights. You do not have that right.”

“I understand.”

“The swordsmanship tournament is imminent. Focus solely on that while you’re in the capital. The Black Wing Knights will not follow you outside the capital.”

“I will keep that in mind.”

Michael responded obediently. Conversations with the Grand Duke were always one-sided.

The Grand Duke never asked about the well-being of Charlotte or Michael. He was someone lacking in parental affection.

Still, if he had to choose, the Grand Duke favored Charlotte. She resembled him more, and although she lacked tact, she had outstanding talent in swordsmanship.

Charlotte was a true swordsman. The Grand Duke liked swordsmen.

Compared to her, Michael was an unsatisfactory child. Though his son, he did not resemble the Grand Duke at all.

Cunning, frail, and lacking in talent with the sword.

However, the Grand Duke recognized Michael’s other talents. His ability to command and manipulate people.

He knew Michael could fulfill his role as the heir of Renosa.

The Grand Duke could think dispassionately for Renosa’s sake That’s why, even though he found Michael unsatisfactory, he considered him as the next master of Renosa due to his other qualities.

‘A child with ambition is better than one without.’

Had Charlotte wanted it, the Grand Duke might have supported her.

But Margret cherished Michael, and Charlotte lacked ambition.

Both father and daughter were swayed by Margret.

Michael knew how to use Margret to get what he wanted.

Using his own mother might seem sly, but it wasn’t something to be criticized. He was a noble.

If the heir of Renosa had been weak, jealous, and incompetent, it would have been a greater problem.

“If you have anything more to say, I will listen.”

Michael knew when to retreat.

He had no more demands from the Grand Duke. Now, he just had to show how well he could perform the tasks given to him.

“The swordsmanship tournament is entirely your responsibility. Make sure it is handled well. You may leave.”

With the Grand Duke’s final words, Michael bowed and left the room.

His eyes were calm as he exited. The boy who had once trembled and couldn’t even speak properly in front of the Grand Duke was no longer there.

Now stood the heir of Renosa.

‘In the end, it will all fall into my hands.’

A cold smile crossed Michael’s lips.

The next day, the Greta Academy group entered the capital.

They were the fourth academy representatives to arrive in the capital.



H.F.C Chapter 221 (Part 1):

`				`The capital of the Principality of Renosa, Ratona. The Greta Academy group entered their smoothly assigned lodging shortly after noon.

This time, they were escorted not by the Black Wing Knights but by Renosa’s soldiers.

Nils’ impression of Ratona was this:

“It may be a small country, but its splendor is not inferior to the Empire’s marketplace.”

His words revealed that he was from the Empire.

In any case, Renosa was a wealthy nation. A small but prosperous country.

As it inherited the imperial bloodline, it maintained quite an amicable relationship with the Empire.

The current Grand Duchess was also from a noble family of the Empire.

Nevertheless, the Principality of Renosa guaranteed its independent status.

“Alright, everyone, head to your assigned rooms. Today, you can eat and rest whenever you wish.”

“Everyone has worked hard so far. It’s been a long journey, right? Rest your bodies in preparation for the upcoming tournament.”

As Instructor Alan and Instructor Patricia finished speaking, they each dispersed to unpack and rest.

No matter how skilled they were in swordsmanship, the journey in carriages all day drained their stamina.

Helmut looked around. This lodging was not exclusively allocated to Greta Academy.

Already, personnel from Loen Academy, who had arrived early, glanced over at them occasionally.

Those who arrived early had already been frequenting the training grounds to prepare for the tournament.

It’s said that Matesis Academy would soon join them here as well.

They had gathered the academy members from Baden in one place in Renosa.

Even though the hand of the temple reached here, it wasn’t as if they were planning something, but it was an odd situation.

Helmut muttered the names of the other two academies in Baden.

‘Matesis and Loen.’

Although his appearance had changed, something was still bothering him.

There was someone from Matesis Academy he recognized from when he split as Hyde.

Gordon, a sixth-year student from Matesis Academy, who had attended the martial arts tournament in Basor and fought against him.

Helmut only recently recalled his presence.

‘If he has the skills to participate in Basor’s martial arts tournament, he must have come here too.’

Helmut judged that his skills were better than those of Nils, who was also in the sixth grade.

But the difference wasn’t significant. They were almost equal.

Gordon was undoubtedly one of the top talents in Matesis Academy. It wouldn’t be wise to think he wouldn’t come.

‘He probably won’t recognize me right away though.’

Just from the face alone. Hyde and Helmut’s images were somewhat different.

However, he was an opponent Helmut had already faced once. Fortunately, Helmut was competing among the lower grades, so he wouldn’t have to face Gordon.

But what if Gordon happened to watch Helmut’s match?

Helmut’s skills were well-known even within Baden. Loen and Matesis might also take an interest.

If Gordon was perceptive, he might sense Hyde’s presence from Helmut’s movements, swordsmanship, and actions—things that couldn’t be changed by a disguise.

A measure was necessary. Helmut wasn’t very good at acting.

He first returned to his room to unpack. He had an idea of what to do.

Just then, as if on cue, he received a contact from Alea. As soon as he entered his room, he accepted her communication.

“Hello.”

Alea waved lightly from beyond the screen-like.

The view behind her was the usual dormitory room.

“So you’ve arrived in Ratona. Is that your room?”

“Yes.”

The room had become noticeably more modest. Although “modest” might not be the right term.

The room, decorated in blue tones, wasn’t as splendid as their first lodging in Renosa, but it was clean and luxurious.

This was the treatment provided equally to all academies.

Even Charlotte wouldn’t be an exception.

“It seems the other two academies from Baden are also staying here.”

“Matesis and Loen? Matesis’ swordsmanship department has a better reputation than Greta’s.”

“That reputation will change this time.”

Helmut smirked, and Alea’s laughter echoed.

“Of course. With you there. At least in the lower grade tournament, Greta will almost certainly win. But the important thing isn’t winning. There’s something more important.”

Her tone had changed. Wasn’t Alea the one who insisted on an absolute victory before?

Helmut tilted his head. There must have been a reason for her change in thought.

Alea spoke with a cautious voice.

“I’ve heard rumors that at least two High Priests are heading to Renosa. To observe the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

As you know, the temple’s permission is why Baden’s academies can participate in this tournament. They want to monitor it. They don’t like Baden.”

The temple likely suspected someone in Baden of the High Priests’ murder. Specifically, someone among the skilled members of Baden’s academies.

But even so, they wouldn’t have sent High Priests just because of the handful of selected members from Greta Academy.

Unless they were certain that the culprit was among them!



H.F.C Chapter 221 (Part 2):

`				`‘But I’m not the one who killed the High Priests.’

Two High Priests were killed, one in Basor and one near Baden, and Alea killed the one closer to Baden.

So Helmut wasn’t the culprit. He thought he was innocent.

The temple might simply be using this opportunity to exert more influence in Renosa while keeping an eye on Baden’s academies.

Renosa was a country under the temple’s influence.

Despite the temple’s declining power over the years, their influence, stemming from saving the world from the Demon King, still spread far and wide.

Helmut understood what Alea was trying to say.

“That means I need to be even more cautious. Even if it means giving up the win. To hide myself.”

It would have been better if he hadn’t come.

Would it have been better to give up like Asuka?

But it was an opportunity to come to Renosa. His mother was in Renosa. If he achieved good results in the swordsmanship tournament, he would naturally have a chance to approach the high-ranking officials of Renosa.

Renosa didn’t take this swordsmanship tournament lightly either.

“Yes, exactly. It could be more dangerous than you think. You… have something you’re looking for there.”

“Yes, there is something I’m looking for here.”

Did she think his attention would be distracted because of that?

Helmut was used to tension. He thought it was unnecessary worry, but he listened attentively.

“Alright, I’ll be careful.”

“About Charlotte…”

Alea hesitated whether to tell him what she found out.

Although Helmut said there was no need to find out, Alea had investigated.

And it wasn’t hard to discover. Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Wesley, a student in the swordsmanship department, already knew this. He had heard it from a high-ranking noble classmate from Renosa.

Then all she had to do was extract information from that classmate. No need for further explanation.

Alea had succeeded and discovered an astonishing fact.

‘If that’s the case, Helmut might be the heir of Renosa’s Grand Duke. At least, a blood relative of the Grand Duke.’

The current Grand Duke family of Renosa had been rather quiet compared to the previous generation.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa, except for the early days of her arrival in Renosa, did not engage much in external activities.

This might be due to the tragedies tied to their family.

But Alea had no way of delving into the distant Renosa from Baden.

She could sneak into Charlotte’s dormitory room and search it, but it wouldn’t yield much valuable information.

Charlotte had little interaction with Renosa and simply led a diligent academy life.

‘Of course, if I poured money into the information guild, I could find out anything.’

Even high-level information could be uncovered. Helmut spoke to Alea, who was hesitating.

“Forget about Charlotte. I’ll find out about Renosa myself. I have a way.”

“Are you going to get information through Black Hawk?”

“Yes.”

“That would be better.”

Alea, who had heard of Talon and Hawk Eye, agreed.

There was still a chance to gather information. This was the perfect time to use it.

‘Could they catch on to something? The possibility is low.’

In Basor, there were the Palma Knights, and in Renosa, there were the Black Wing Knights.

Since they had investigated the Palma Knights, it would be natural to investigate the Black Wing Knights as well.

Helmut was participating in the swordsmanship tournament in Renosa.

It could be perceived as proactive job seeking.

For example, looking for a future job in advance.

This would also obscure the intent behind gathering information on the Palma Knights and the high-ranking officials of Basor.

‘The Black Wing Knights and the Grand Duke family of Renosa.’

After finishing his conversation with Alea, Helmut requested exactly that from Talon.

Talon agreed to send the information to Helmut without any objections.

However, he also mentioned that it would take about a week.

With this, the opportunity to gather information was once again utilized.

The remaining chance for information had to be saved for when it was really necessary.

Of course, Talon would provide information as long as Helmut paid, so it was wise to keep the connection.

\*

After a simple meal, Helmut left the lodging in the afternoon. He had remembered something he needed to do.

Today, they had permission to act freely.

Of course, they should not cause any trouble.

Renosa had good public order, so unless he picked a fight, there was hardly any trouble to be had.

Unlike the rough-natured people of Basor, Renosa’s people were relatively calm, despite their reverence for swordsmen.

They only glanced at Helmut without approaching or speaking to him.

The streets were quiet and clean, similar to the academic atmosphere of Baden.

Helmut casually strolled through the city of Ratona and headed straight to the blacksmith’s.

He had looked it up before leaving the lodging.

He was empty-handed for the first time in a while. He had his sword, but it was stored in his spatial pocket.

Renosa was not known for its swords, so few people bought swords here, but Helmut needed a Renosa sword.

He couldn’t wield Darien’s sword, which might be recognized by someone.

‘Something decent enough to use will suffice.’

There was no need to buy an expensive, high-quality sword. He just intended to buy something moderate and ordinary for disguise purposes.

Helmut was participating in a lower-grade academy tournament.

No matter how skilled a third-year was, it would be difficult for them to withstand Helmut’s single strike.

There was no need to use Vis either. He could easily handle his opponents without even getting used to a new sword.

But there was one criterion for choosing the sword.

‘A sword with a different weight or form slightly changes the swordsmanship.’

Helmut intended to buy a sword distinguishable from Darien’s sword.



H.F.C Chapter 222 (Part 1):

`				`Helmut frowned.

Gordon. How did he find out that he was affiliated with the Matesis Academy?

As he walked, he suddenly recalled someone’s voice.

‘Gordon? Ah, he’s a swordsman from Basor. He’s in his sixth year at Matesis Academy. He won’t be a difficult opponent for Hyde. It’ll be easy.’

Michael. He was the most peculiar noble among those Helmut had encountered. Not just Gordon, but Michael was also a problem.

‘Could he have come to Renosa?’

However, if he was an imperial citizen, Renosa wasn’t far from the Empire. It was entirely possible for him to come here.

Moreover, he had heard that some people particularly paid attention to such martial arts tournaments or swordsmanship tournaments.

Helmut had drawn too much attention at the martial arts tournament in Basor.

‘I need to be careful.’

Would there be someone as skilled as Luke Yeager or a member of the Palma Knights in this swordsmanship tournament?

It didn’t seem likely, but there was a slight sense of expectation.

Whether it was because of the swordsmanship tournament or because it was a holiday, Renosa’s streets were bustling.

Helmut pushed through the crowd and finally arrived at the blacksmith’s shop.

There were a few ready-made swords at the blacksmith’s. Helmut chose one that was heavier and longer than Darien’s sword and paid for it.

‘This should be enough.’

It was a sturdy sword. Quite high quality.

The blacksmith tilted his head as Helmut immediately selected a sword upon arriving.

“You’re not making one yourself?”

“I need a sword right away, and this one is perfect.”

“Then please wait a moment. I’ll adjust it to fit you. It will take about thirty minutes.”

The blacksmith took Helmut’s grip measurements and went to work on the sword.

Waiting in the second-floor lounge, Helmut glanced out the window. The outside seemed somewhat noisy.

A white carriage was racing down the main road. People were scattering to the sides to make way.

There were no crests on the carriage, making it impossible to tell which noble family it belonged to.

There were also nobles who traveled in carriages without crests if it wasn’t official business.

This way, they wouldn’t become targets.

However, the guards around the carriage were unusual.

Helmut narrowed his eyes. He felt a chill.

Through the carriage window, Helmut caught a glimpse of something. It was bright blond hair.

Blond hair wasn’t rare, but for some reason, it looked familiar.

‘Michael.’

Was it because he had been thinking about him a moment ago? It felt too coincidental to be a coincidence.

The carriage soon passed, and the street was once again crowded. Helmut received his sword and left the blacksmith’s shop.

If that was Michael, Helmut needed to hide his identity from those who knew about the temple, Michael, and Hyde.

It was uncertain if it was possible without an early exit from the tournament.

“Michael?”

It was a name she was hearing for the first time. Alea narrowed her eyes. Helmut briefly explained what had happened in Basor.

Because Michael was not directly involved in the central events, he had never properly talked about him.

“Do you know which noble family he’s from?”

“I know he’s from the Empire. If that’s his real name, I should be able to find out from Talon’s report.”

Now it was time to wait for Talon’s report. Alea spoke bluntly.

“If he’s very curious about you and smart, he’s dangerous. Can you just kill and get rid of him?”

“If he’s a high-ranking noble, it will be problematic.”

Helmut was not accustomed to assassination. How could he find and kill Michael unnoticed in Renosa?

“I mean, do you have the mindset to kill him if necessary?”

“I’d rather not.”

Helmut answered without hesitation. Michael had shown him kindness. Repaying kindness with death was not something Helmut desired.

Moreover, he found something about him bothersome. Not in a negative way, but it was just something that caught his attention.

‘He’s like Charlotte. But he doesn’t resemble Charlotte much.’

Nor did he resemble Helmut. It was hard to suspect any blood relation with Michael.

Although fraternal twins don’t necessarily have to look alike, Charlotte and Michael looked like they could be siblings when placed side by side.

Their personalities were also different. Charlotte was stern, while Michael was gentle and kind. They each resembled their father and mother.

Alea suggested,

“Alright then… how about changing your swordsmanship style?”

“Change my style?”

“Not the swordsmanship of the Sword Saint, but the common swordsmanship you use. But I heard there are subtle differences even in common swordsmanship. The one you use is probably similar to Basor’s style, right?”

Even common swordsmanship couldn’t be exactly the same across regions.



H.F.C Chapter 222 (Part 2):

`				`In Basor, people often fought monsters. Naturally, the swordsmanship also had Basor’s characteristics.

Darien, who taught Helmut, was particularly influenced by this.

“How about trying imperial common swordsmanship?”

In fact, Alea didn’t know if it was such an easy thing. She knew changing swordsmanship in just a few days wasn’t easy, but somehow Helmut seemed capable.

And it was something Helmut could do. He had reached a level where he could mimic any swordsmanship he had seen once.

Helmut suddenly recalled that there were students at the academy who used common swordsmanship.

Many students used their family’s swordsmanship, but sometimes, common swordsmanship was better than sloppy family swordsmanship.

Common swordsmanship was refined and polished for fundamentals.

‘If it’s imperial common swordsmanship… yeah, It feels more standard and balanced.’

He remembered that the stances and sword directions were subtly different. Having bought a new sword, changing his swordsmanship would make him look even less like Hyde.

Wouldn’t Greta Academy notice this change and find it strange?

‘It probably won’t be an issue.’

Helmut had finished most of his duels quickly. There hadn’t been much time for instructors to notice his Basor-style swordsmanship.

“Let’s try that then.”

Helmut nodded. It wasn’t difficult. He remembered the subtle differences between the imperial and Basor styles.

He could train with the new sword while adapting to the new style.

Alea looked at Helmut with worried eyes.

She was safe in Baden. Undeniably, Heike was behind her.

A powerful archmage who didn’t care if the temple declared her an enemy.

But Helmut was different. There was no one to protect him. He had practically walked into the enemy’s den.

Even though she had discovered his identity, Helmut was still alone.

Alea made up her mind.

‘I should head to Renosa as soon as possible.’

It would be better to handle the situation with both of them there. The fact that two high priests were heading there made her particularly uneasy.

With two high priests, Helmut, who had the Seed of Darkness, wouldn’t be able to withstand a direct confrontation if his identity was exposed.

He might not even be able to escape.

“A high priest has died, and they know about you in Basor. So, you should be more careful about hiding yourself. Even if you have to postpone the timing.”

The timing Alea referred to was, of course, the time for him to meet his mother.

Helmut had been carefully waiting for the right moment, not desperately searching. He thought it would be delayed until he gained enough power.

He hadn’t expected to get close to his mother so soon.

However, this quick approach only made him more anxious.

He reached Ratona, the capital of Renosa. It might be his birthplace, but it didn’t move him much.

What was more important were the upcoming events. He was now just one step away.

Helmut was almost there. At times like this, he needed to be extra careful.

His oversights and mistakes could turn his perseverance and efforts so far into nothing.

Helmut didn’t return to carry the burden of the temple’s enmity with his family and mother.

Helmut affirmed.

“Yes, the swordsmanship tournament is the issue for now. I’ve arrived in Renosa, so it wouldn’t be bad to drop out early.”

That might be more freeing. Achieving excellent results would make it easier to approach his mother, but now that he was in Renosa, other methods would arise.

Ways to approach Renosa’s nobles. Anyway, the selected participants of the swordsmanship tournament were treated like nobles while staying in Renosa.

It wouldn’t be difficult to get invited to a noble’s banquet.

He had heard that those who dropped out early turned to socializing to build connections.

‘If Charlotte is a high-ranking noble, I might be able to use her.’

Feigning illness to withdraw wouldn’t be a bad idea.

It wasn’t the time to think about the honor of Greta Academy or the obligations of selected participants.

Charlotte would fulfill that role faithfully.

“See you tomorrow.”

Alea waved as she finished the conversation. After she disappeared, Helmut fell into thought.

Winning was natural for him. It wasn’t easy to give up the victory.

Even Helmut wanted to return as a strong and radiant winner.

Pretending to be weak or deliberately losing was not something he was used to. Withdrawal seemed better.

Helmut leaned towards the idea of withdrawal.

Despite the expectations and hopes of the Greta Academy faculty and second-year students, it was a weight he could shake off.

He always kept a cool head.

However, in the end, Helmut did not withdraw from the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Because he faced an unexpected situation.

The next day, just three days before the tournament, the Matesis Academy team arrived, exuding confidence.

They were the favorites to win the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

They were considered the most likely to win by external evaluations, although Greta Academy did not agree.

They had always performed well in exchange duels with Greta and Loen.

‘Gordon is here too.’

Indeed, he was. Helmut observed them with indifferent eyes.

Having swung the sword a bit last night, he had gotten used to the new sword and swordsmanship. The chances of Gordon recognizing him were low.

Sure enough, Gordon did not recognize Helmut. Instead, he looked at him with a slightly dissatisfied expression and passed by.

This was not just Gordon, but the other selected members of Matesis Academy too.

‘These Greta guys look pretty lacking overall. Young ages and even a girl.’

The selected members of Greta Academy were generally young.

First-year Charlotte and second-year Helmut. Neither were big or prematurely aged.

Even the upperclassman representative Leon was only a fourth-year.

Charlotte, who looked particularly fragile, was enough to make them look down on Greta Academy.



H.F.C Chapter 223 (Part 1):

`				`It’s unusual for there to be no problems when the selected members from three rival academies are gathered in one place.

Especially when those members are energetic and highly skilled swordsmen.

The other academies are likely hoping for some turmoil to weaken their competition.

As for Renosa, they did not wish for the newly joined Baden Academy to win either.

Because even they cannot completely avoid the scrutiny of the temple.

Even if Baden’s academy won fairly, the temple would harbor dissatisfaction.

From the temple’s perspective, it was unthinkable for a group of non-believers from Baden to win.

Renosa wouldn’t intervene in the results, but they subtly hoped for other academies to perform well.

Regardless of their wishes, the highest level was concentrated in Baden Academy.

That’s why people went to great lengths to send their children to Baden, even from distant foreign lands.

Among them, the most famous for swordsmanship is Matesis Academy.

However, the difference in level with Greta and Loen wasn’t significant, and their reputations often fluctuated, so it couldn’t be said that they were definitively superior.

In contrast, the magic department of Greta Academy was uniquely renowned.

Lately, Greta instructors considered themselves superior to Matesis.

However, the Matesis instructors underestimated the selected members of Greta Academy.

They provoked the Greta Academy members in subtle ways.

The day after they arrived at the Ratona lodgings, a Matesis instructor requested a meeting with the faculty.

It was a meeting excluding Loen Academy.

The Matesis instructor opened his mouth with a confident attitude:

“We request a duel between four members from Greta Academy and our members.”

“A duel with our members?”

“Yes, throughout the competition period if possible. Unless they are immediate opponents, we wish to duel every day. It’s preferable for seniors to face seniors and juniors to face juniors.”

“A duel at this point, with the tournament just ahead…”

Instructor Alan expressed slight disapproval at the sudden proposal.

He thought it could lead to wasted effort.

Moreover, the tournament brackets haven’t even been announced yet. The brackets were to be drawn on the first day of the tournament.

They might end up facing Matesis right away, so was there a need for the duels?

In Baden, they might have accepted it as part of academy exchange.

“The Matesis swordsmanship department hones its skills through systematic dueling. Sometimes, we even hire mercenaries. We often hold real sword duels. We mentioned this because we’ve been busy traveling and haven’t been able to duel, so we’re concerned about losing our edge.”

The selected members of Matesis stayed at the academy until the last minute, focusing on training.

They were the most eager to win among all the academies.

“If you’re worried about injuries, we will take utmost care. We have two magic department instructors who can provide immediate treatment. Since it would be limited to four people, it’s not a bad proposal for Greta Academy either, is it?”

That was true. However, the provocative attitude of Matesis was somewhat irksome.

Yet, it didn’t seem right to reject a beneficial proposal for the students just because it was annoying.

The three faculty members exchanged glances, asking each other what they should do.

Then, the Matesis instructor added,

“Of course, we’d prefer to exclude Loen Academy. It would be best if the duels were only between Greta and Matesis, which is why we’re discussing this separately.”

“Why is that?”

“Do you really not understand?”

The Matesis instructor laughed. Naturally, they immediately understood the meaning.

It was a suggestion to exclude Loen, treating them as a common enemy.

But it seemed somewhat petty. Despite being competitors, they were all from Baden.

Excluding one out of three didn’t look good.

Loen might complain later, saying they had no honor or anything.

While Greta Academy’s magic department was formidable and pragmatic in nature,

on the flip side, their swordsmanship department had some old-fashioned tendencies.

The three faculty members, who were hesitating, finally found common ground. There was no need to cause trouble over a duel that could go either way.

Instructor Alan spoke on their behalf.

“That is an unacceptable proposal. We do not seek discord. You may extend the same offer to Loen Academy, but Greta cannot accept a duel that excludes one side in that manner.”

“Do the others share this sentiment?”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

Professor Luxen and Instructor Patricia firmly agreed.

The Matesis instructor shrugged.

“In that case, there’s nothing we can do. I thought it was a good opportunity. However, we won’t make the same offer to the Loen Academy. Rest assured.”

The Matesis instructor ended the conversation decisively. But there was a strange smile on his lips.



H.F.C Chapter 223 (Part 2):

`				`Shortly after the Matesis instructor bowed and left, Instructor Patricia exploded with anger.

“They won’t make the same proposal to Loen? They’re saying they don’t need to be cautious with us!”

It wasn’t to avoid offending Greta, whom they proposed to first.

If that were the case, they wouldn’t have suggested excluding Loen.

Matesis and Loen weren’t in a relationship where they were competing over Greta. In fact, the two academies had a rather good relationship.

In Baden, Matesis and Loen were close, with Greta on the opposite side.

In other words, Matesis judged that they could afford to reveal their strength to Greta, but not to Loen.

They deemed Greta an easy opponent that didn’t require caution.

This was their evaluation of Greta.

It was natural for the faculty, especially the instructors, to feel anger.

Professor Luxen responded calmly.

“Well, our selected members do appear young to them. They probably have information on Loen and thought it was worth preparing for them. But they must have judged that our members wouldn’t pose much of a challenge in a duel.”

Instructor Patricia raised her eyebrows.

“Are you going to speak so calmly about this, Professor Luxen?”

“What can we do? We’ll just have to show them in the tournament. We must not let their opinions affect our students’ pride. Friction in the dorms will only cause fatigue.”

“It might be good to hurt their pride. It could motivate them.”

Instructor Alan spoke up.

“Well, the swordsmanship students are sensitive to ranks and competition. It could be a good stimulus.”

Professor Luxen quietly agreed. His main concern remained Helmut.

\*

Needless to say, Matesis Academy didn’t let it go quietly.

The Matesis instructor only explained to their selected members that Greta had refused, and thus the duel didn’t happen.

He didn’t explain the reason.

After all, as competitors, a bit of discord was better than getting along well.

The Matesis swordsmanship department adhered to the logic of power more than any other swordsmanship department.

They resented Greta’s refusal to duel, seeing it as a missed opportunity to learn.

Did Greta think they could compete equally without revealing their strength?

This almost arrogant resentment eventually found an outlet. As long as there were no physical confrontations, they could act freely.

Drawing that line, they moved relentlessly.

The most enthusiastic and diligent in practice among Greta’s selected members was Charlotte.

Even after coming to Renosa, she didn’t expect special treatment.

She wanted to showcase her skills fairly.

She hoped her efforts would pay off in the swordsmanship tournament.

But she also didn’t want to be eliminated early in a disgraceful manner.

Thus, Charlotte did everything she could and hoped for luck.

If she met a championship contender in the first round, the chances of being eliminated would be high. So all she could do was hope the draw wouldn’t turn out that way.

She had at least a minimal belief that Michael wouldn’t intentionally rig it.

The instructors didn’t hide their high expectations of her.

She received encouragement constantly. It was different from the absolute expectations on Helmut.

After all, being a first-year selected participant wasn’t something that could happen by chance alone.

Charlotte had skill, talent, and diligence. The instructors hoped she would perform well in the swordsmanship tournament.

Expectations grew.

To meet these expectations, Charlotte arrived early at the training ground.

She wasn’t given the privilege of a private training ground.

Renosa could only provide a temporary location, so they couldn’t give her that much preferential treatment.

Each academy was given a spacious shared training ground.

However, someone was already there today.

Charlotte stopped when she saw two Matesis Academy members practicing swordsmanship in the center of the training ground.

At that moment, she didn’t suspect they had any other intentions.

“Excuse me, this is the training ground allocated to Greta Academy.”

“Ah, is that so?”

Matesis members Robin and Taren greeted Charlotte calmly. She responded calmly.

“Please move to the training ground allocated to Matesis Academy.”

However, they didn’t leave willingly.

“Sorry, but this training ground is more comfortable. Our training ground over there is a bit uneven because of intense practice yesterday.”

“Since we arrived first, we’d like to use this one.”

“That’s nonsense.”

Charlotte looked at them in disbelief. She had a bad feeling.

“Understand. We’ve already warmed up, and moving is a hassle.”

“We’re in a hurry. We arrived later than expected, so we need to train quickly.”

Robin and Taren smiled and conversed nonchalantly.

Their expressions didn’t seem flustered or apologetic.

Charlotte firmly declared,

“That won’t do. Please move. Otherwise, it will escalate into an issue between academies.”



H.F.C Chapter 224 (Part 1):

`				`“You’re being quite fussy over nothing.”

“This much should be understandable, right? We’re already in the middle of training.”

“Yeah, since Greta’s people arrived early. We’re all from Baden’s academies, so stop being so stingy!”

Charlotte refuted their nonsensical remarks.

“We only arrived a day early. And that goes against the rules.”

“Well then, let’s talk to the instructors when they wake up.”

“Anyway, we need to finish our training.”

Robin and Taren exchanged smug smiles, looking at each other as if daring her to report them.

It seemed clear that they didn’t know who Charlotte was, or perhaps they were just late to hear the rumors.

Charlotte felt relieved, but as relieved as she was, she grew angry.

She knew their intentions. It was a common dominance dispute among swordsmanship students.

She had experienced similar things during her first semester at Greta.

Even though Charlotte was the only, and pretty girl, in the first-year swordsmanship department, there were still some who didn’t care about that.

Those individuals inevitably picked fights with her.

Of course, by the time Charlotte became the top of her first-year swordsmanship class, even the most persistent ones had given up.

Charlotte knew she shouldn’t show weakness to such opponents.

“That won’t do. Please move aside.”

Charlotte cut them off with a tone that left no room for argument.

Robin and Taren ignored her and started their training, swinging their swords.

They were using real swords. Matesis Academy emphasized real sword duels, which was why it had the highest number of injuries.

They were also selected members. Their basic moves were impressive, with their swords slicing through the air with formidable force.

Their attitude was clear: what are you going to do about it?

There were two of them and only one Charlotte. The instructors would soon wake up, and she could tell them about it.

But this kind of provocation shouldn’t be resolved that way. She was also a swordsmanship student.

Charlotte drew her sword without hesitation. It was a real sword, as they were preparing for the tournament.

Robin and Taren seemed indifferent to whatever she was about to do.

Charlotte’s sword intercepted Robin’s downward strike.

Clang!

A sharp noise rang out.

Robin frowned.

“What do you think you’re doing?”

Though not threatening, her sword thrust forward chillingly fast.

A sword imbued with Vis was hard to underestimate. For a moment, Robin stiffened.

“It means you two can’t train here. I’m going to stop you.”

It was a rare provocative attitude from Charlotte. Her gaze was intense.

Robin growled.

“Look at this? How insolent!”

“Being insolent is better than being dull-witted, I’d say. I told you this is Greta Academy’s training ground.”

Taren chuckled and nodded.

“Why don’t you just deal with her? Make her understand.”

It was clear what he meant: make her understand through skill.

Taren ranked higher than Robin, so it was Robin’s job to teach this fearless girl a lesson.

“If you want, I’ll take you on. A real sword duel.”

“Very well.”

Charlotte nodded. It was a good opportunity for her as well.

At Greta Academy, most seniors avoided dueling with her for fear of losing and being humiliated.

But these two seemed eager, confident they wouldn’t lose.

The opposite, in fact. The reason was that they didn’t think Charlotte could ever beat them.

‘At least they don’t seem to be planning to gang up on me together, thankfully.’

Matesis’ standards were high. There was no guarantee Charlotte could beat either Robin or Taren.

But unlike when facing Helmut, she didn’t feel like she would definitely lose.

Charlotte was often underestimated, but she had also achieved many unexpected victories.

Winning against complacent opponents was something she had done countless times.

And Charlotte trusted her instincts. While she wasn’t sure about Taren, she felt she could handle Robin. She could definitely win.

Robin sneered.

“Well, let’s introduce ourselves first. I’m Robin, a third-year at Matesis Academy.”

“Charlotte, a first-year at Greta Academy.”

Robin looked at her with disbelief.

“A first-year? This is a joke. Doesn’t Greta have any better talent? Or is it because you’re pretty that no one bothers to swing a sword properly at you?”

“Thank you for the compliment. Though not the kind of compliment I’d like.”

It was a familiar treatment. Everyone underestimated Charlotte. But as the Duchess of Renosa, she had never been underestimated, even by the Commander of the Black Wing Knights himself.

And Charlotte always showed them with her sword. Because that’s how swordsmen communicate.

“Doesn’t matter either way. I won’t go easy on you just because you’re a girl. You’re going to get a real lesson today.”

“We’ll see who gets taught a lesson.”

“Your mouth is sharp! But not for long.”

Robin glared at Charlotte with fierce eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 224 (Part 2):

`				`Taren stepped aside, sheathing his sword, ready to watch Robin humiliate Charlotte.

Charlotte and Robin positioned themselves at a proper distance, ready to begin the duel.

‘Here comes trouble.’

Robin and Taren’s eyes widened at the sight of the black-haired boy who appeared without any warning. They too failed to notice Helmut’s approach.

Helmut, as he was called, had an extraordinary aura despite his noble appearance.

His jet-black eyes were somehow hard to look straight into.

But they weren’t the type to be intimidated. They hesitated only for a moment.

“Ah, is this what you call a senior?”

Robin sneered, looking Helmut up and down.

Robin had a naturally irritating appearance, but he found Helmut’s handsome features even more annoying.

Moreover, Helmut didn’t seem particularly physically imposing regardless of the aura.

In the lower grades, physical condition and swordsmanship often determined the outcome more than Vis.

That’s why the selected members of Greta Academy were underestimated this time too.

“A referee? Sure, why not. One from Matesis, one from Greta. Just watch.”

Taren quickly concluded. Helmut leisurely walked to the side.

‘What kind of kid walks without making a sound?’

He gave off an eerie assassin-like vibe more than a swordsman. Taren glanced at him.

Helmut didn’t seem to notice Taren’s gaze. He thought Charlotte wouldn’t lose, but if she did, he would step in.

The opponent would then be Taren, but there was no need to worry about him yet. He was just a small fry.

The atmosphere calmed down, and Taren announced the start.

“One, two, three!”

The duel between Charlotte and Robin was intense.

Robin barely managed to block Charlotte’s first attack.

‘How is she so fast?’

He almost failed to counter it. It was a sword strike that could take his nose off while he watched. But it wasn’t beyond Robin’s skills to block it.

He soon realized that Charlotte’s skills were far superior to what he had imagined.

Flexible, fast, and agile. Unlike any opponent he had faced before.

‘No wonder she’s a selected member.’

He realized that the duel wouldn’t end as easily as he had thought.

A swordsman knows the strength of their opponent the moment their swords clash.

Robin wasn’t a complete fool. He discarded his complacency.

He didn’t think he would lose, but he decided to go all out.

However, even with full strength, the duel didn’t end easily. Instead, Robin felt he was on the defensive.

Charlotte had sparred numerous times with Nils, a superior version of Robin. Having gotten used to Nils, facing Robin was easier.

And with that ease, Charlotte overpowered Robin’s sword!

However, before Charlot could seize victory, the duel was inevitably cut short.

It was due to someone who appeared around the time their bodies were drenched in sweat.

“Stop right there! A real sword duel without an instructor’s supervision? What are you thinking!”

A cold command rang out. It was Instructor Alan.

Charlotte and Robin froze in place. Taren’s face stiffened.

Only Helmut remained calm. He had been thinking that Charlotte’s skills had significantly improved.

“Why are Matesis Academy’s selected members here? This is clearly Greta Academy’s training ground. Explain what happened.”

Taren adjusted his expression and smiled as he replied.

“We just came to the wrong training ground, and they immediately picked a fight. It seems Greta Academy’s swordsmanship students lack patience.”

“That’s not true! We asked them to move, but they refused!”

Charlotte glared at Taren with infuriated eyes. He shamelessly lifted his chin.

Robin, drenched in sweat, couldn’t even lift his head.

He had struggled against a mere first-year girl.

He hadn’t felt anywhere near victory. He probably would have lost.

Taren must have noticed this too.

If the senior representatives of the upper years found out, they would scold him for tarnishing Matesis’s reputation.

Robin ground his teeth.

“Charlotte doesn’t lie.”

“Well, it is true that we asked to use the training ground for a bit longer. There were two of us and one of her at the time.”

“So a fight broke out, leading to a duel. Didn’t you think to inform an instructor?”

“We thought they were still resting.”

Charlotte replied confidently. She was a model student and knew how to act accordingly.

Avoiding a provocation by reporting to an instructor was typical model student behavior, but not suitable for the top first-year swordsmanship student.

Instructor Alan looked at the two Matesis students with a cold expression.

“If you want to compete properly, do it on the stage. There will be an opportunity soon. Such induced duels are unacceptable.”

Even he couldn’t put the Matesis students on the floor and stomp on them, not with the tournament approaching.

Taron lightly apologized with a relaxed face.

“My apologies.”

“This incident will be reported to Matesis. I hope it doesn’t happen again. Next time, I won’t let it slide with just words. Understood?”

“Yes.”

Taren bowed neatly and immediately left the training ground, dragging Robin with him.

Their intention was to face the Greta selected members, not the instructors.

Thus, the situation seemed to be resolved for now.



H.F.C Chapter 225 (Part 1):

`				`That day, an argument broke out between the faculty of Matesis and Greta.

Though it wasn’t a physical altercation, it was an unpleasant dispute.

Matesis did issue an apology, but it was insincere.

“We apologize. However, you seem to be shielding your students like noble ladies. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing.”

That day, Instructor Alan, unusually losing his composure, told the selected Greta students not to even think about losing to Matesis.

Previously, he tried not to burden them, hoping they would showcase their skills admirably. This time, his reaction was completely different.

At that time, Helmut didn’t think too deeply about it.

Wasn’t it a dispute that could happen anywhere?

In fact, despite what Instructor Alan had said, Helmut was inclined to just drop out appropriately.

The important thing was to do it without it being obvious.

Having never been sick since birth, it was hard for him to drop out due to illness.

‘What excuse should I use to drop out?’

Given his skill, where he could defeat most opponents with a single strike, it was difficult to lose as long as he could stand on the stage, even if he had a high fever.

Helmut couldn’t find a suitable excuse, and neither could the clever Alea.

“Why don’t you just say some urgent matter came up and leave, then come back later?”

“What urgent matter?”

“Just run away and come back later, saying it was a family matter and keeping quiet?”

“Would the faculty let me off?”

Helmut had come here as a representative of the Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department.

Such behavior could lead to disciplinary action. He might even lose his eligibility as a selected member.

In that case, meeting his mother with a clear status would become impossible.

“Well, that’s true. How about this? What if someone put a laxative in your drink?”

“If that happened, I’d become famous in another way.”

There would be a fuss about finding the culprit, and Helmut would be known as the selected member who ran to the bathroom after taking a laxative at the swordsmanship tournament.

Helmut didn’t want such dishonor, and Alea agreed.

“Yeah, you’re right.”

In the end, it was up to Helmut to find a suitable way to drop out.

Although there were some glares, there were no further clashes with Matesis.

The uncomfortable coexistence of Matesis, Loen, and Greta continued.

A few days later, the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament finally began.

The opening ceremony was lively with all the academy members attending.

The Greta swordsmanship students, wearing their famously stylish uniforms, definitely stood out.

Especially the attention focused on Charlotte was overwhelming. She was the only girl among the selected members of the eight academies. Fortunately, no one seemed to recognize her.

The opening ceremony, though interspersed with grand trumpet sounds, flowed as boringly as a dean’s sermon.

The Grand Duke of Renosa did not show up. Although it was a swordsmanship tournament involving eight prestigious academies, it wasn’t as grand an event as the Basor Martial Arts Tournament.

Helmut looked around the audience and the noble seats to see if he recognized any faces, but aside from a few nobles he’d seen in Basor, there was nothing noteworthy.

The reason Helmut didn’t see Michael that day was simple. Michael had fallen ill again.

Moreover, the Grand Duke of Renosa wouldn’t have brought Michael, who wasn’t yet confirmed as the heir, to this event.

Helmut focused on another fact.

‘Has the High Priest not arrived yet?’

Whether they were delayed or had other matters, the two High Priests who were supposed to come to Renosa were nowhere to be seen.

It might be better to confirm and be vigilant today.

He couldn’t be sure if that was a good thing. It would be best if they didn’t come at all.

‘I haven’t received any contact from Talon yet either.’

Since he wouldn’t directly deliver the documents to the lodgings, he’d have to go look for Ratona’s mercenary guild.

Helmut still didn’t have information about Renosa’s high-ranking officials.

Right now, the tournament was all that lay ahead. He had familiarized himself with the new sword and swordsmanship techniques just in case.

And soon the matchup bracket was announced. Helmut and Charlotte could only face each other in the finals based on the bracket.

This tournament had no losers’ bracket. Mistakes would not be permitted.

‘But my first opponent is……’

It didn’t specify the academy, only the name.

‘Taren?’

If there was no one else with the same name, Taren was the Matesis selected member who had a conflict with Charlotte.

Though he had no grudge, he remembered. Of all the opponents, he had to face him first.

As soon as the matchups were announced, Instructors Patricia and Alan grabbed Helmut’s shoulders with serious eyes.

“You must win!”

“We’re counting on you.”



H.F.C Chapter 225 (Part 2):

`				`It was an intensity that even Helmut felt pressured by. If he were to lose, by any tiny chance, the consequences were worrisome.

Of course, Helmut didn’t care about their wishes. Well, it wasn’t that he didn’t care at all, but there was something more important.

His mind needed to stay calm. Because Helmut was about to take action. Petty things like pride or expectations didn’t matter……

At least, that’s what he had thought.

But the moment he stepped onto the tournament arena, those kinds of thoughts vanished completely.

Seeing Helmut on the stage, Taren sneered disdainfully.

“Hello, Baden comrade. You’ve arrived?”

The tone of “arrived” was peculiar. Taren, with his hand on his waist, looked provocatively at Helmut.

“I thought you’d use the excuse of being sick to run away.”

“”Run away?”

“I heard you telling the instructors that your body wasn’t feeling well, that your condition wasn’t good so you might not be able to perform properly. But from what I saw, you don’t seem that bad off to me.”

“…..?”

He heard that? Helmut had been emphasizing to the instructors that his condition wasn’t good, trying to lessen the pressure on him.

He had shut his mouth when he almost got checked by Professor Luxen, but.

Helmut was too strong. And too healthy. There was no way he could find an excuse to lose to this guy or skip the tournament.

‘In many ways, it’s a tough situation to avoid.’

With the careless thought that he’d find a way somehow, Helmut had uncharacteristically come up on stage.

Since the senior tournament was being held simultaneously, this side was somewhat less crowded.

Taren still had an annoying look on his face.

“It’s not too late even now. Feel free to make an excuse. Why don’t you try running away? Wouldn’t avoiding be better for keeping your dignity than losing? If you drop out from the first round, your instructors will be embarrassed.”

Helmut had grown quite indifferent to provocations. He had encountered many provocations before.

But for some reason… he couldn’t let this one slide. Should he lose to this guy even after hearing such words?

Of course, losing was the right thing to do. The High Priest hadn’t appeared yet. There were many variables. Winning the swordsmanship tournament wouldn’t bring a huge reward. The reward was rather modest.

So, for his goal, it would be better to endure and back down.

However.

“After this match is over.”

“After it’s over?”

“I have a question to ask you. Will you answer?”

Helmut abandoned formalities. Taren was a third-year. He was older, but there was no need to respect someone who provoked him. He wasn’t Charlotte.

“Well, sure. I’m curious about the question.”

Taren made a sly expression. He still seemed confident.

The Greta selected members were considered inferior to the Matesis selected members. Matesis was the favorite to win.

Everyone thought so, except for the people from Greta Academy. Even Loen Academy only kept an eye on Matesis, not caring much about Greta.

Just as everyone thought, Taren thought so too. Moreover, hadn’t Greta refused this side’s duel proposal?

If Matesis was going to win anyway, they could have helped as a fellow academy from Baden.

For that trivial reason, the belligerent Matesis selected members held a grudge and provoked them.

It was okay to do that to Charlotte. Charlotte wasn’t that strong. But doing the same to Helmut was a different matter.

Soon, the announcement echoed.

“Matesis Academy’s representative Taren! Greta Academy’s representative Helmut! Start immediately when the signal sounds!”

Taren, who had been relaxed, suddenly focused and put his hand on his waist.

No matter how easy the opponent seemed, he had been trained not to be careless.

In contrast, Helmut was composed. He calmly placed his hand on the sword hilt.

Not Darian’s sword, but a newly purchased one. A good sword, but incomparable in quality.

But didn’t they say a carpenter doesn’t blame his tools? His sword was sharp enough to cut through a person’s neck.

‘I probably shouldn’t kill though.’

Helmut leisurely gripped the sword hilt. The comprehensive swordsmanship tournament was fought with real swords.

But according to the rules, killing was forbidden. Excessive cruelty and dismembering or torturing the opponent were also prohibited.

In unavoidable cases, casualties could happen, but that was literally unavoidable.

There was no need to use the sword either. Helmut knew a better way.

- Booooong!

Soon, the signal rang out. Helmut immediately sprang into action. His sword remained in its sheath.

Taren drew his sword. But that was the last thing he remembered.

Pak! The massive impact knocked him out instantly. The spinning vision found its place at some point.

‘What, what is this? What….’

The sky was upside down. When he regained consciousness, Taren realized he was lying on the stage, looking at the sky.

Excruciating pain shot through him. Helmut’s first sword strike was slamming the sword hilt into his head.

Helmut struck Taren’s falling body five times with the sword hilt. The pain was guaranteed.

Taren grimaced and groaned in agony. Indescribable pain spread throughout his body.

Helmut lightly pointed his sword at Taren’s neck. A calm question followed.

“What did you say earlier?”

Taren couldn’t answer. His pride was shattered, and he was in no condition to respond.

Soon, the familiar announcement echoed.

“Helmut wins!”

Helmut left the stage, leaving the fallen Taren behind.

A feeling of unease lingered. The plan had gone awry. It wasn’t that elaborate of a plan, but still.

‘Winning one round should be fine.’

There were still more matches. Even if he lost the next match, it wouldn’t be a big problem.

Helmut tried to justify himself.

His dropout plan had failed so far. And it was uncertain if it would succeed in the future.



H.F.C Chapter 226 (Part 1):

`				`Now, there were two people avoiding Helmut at the dormitory: Leon and Taren.

Taren said he eventually couldn’t get up on stage that day and was carried out.

Although no one saw it properly, it was known that Helmut won without drawing his sword.

The memorable scene of him beating his opponent with just the scabbard, fortunately, didn’t spread much due to the lack of witnesses.

However, it was gradually becoming known, especially about the tremendous gap in skill he displayed.

As soon as Helmut returned to the dormitory that day, he received a lot of attention.

Especially the gazes from the Matesis guys felt piercing.

It turned out that Taren was considered a top contender among the lower-year representatives. Although Robin was also skilled, he wasn’t on Taren’s level.

In other words, from that day on, Helmut became the strongest contender in the dormitory.

“You showed that Matesis guy what you’re made of, didn’t you?”

That afternoon, Nils passed by patting Helmut’s shoulder as he said that. Charlotte also hardened her expression and said,

“Senior, I don’t think it’s right to expose your true abilities in the early stages of the tournament. But you were still amazing.”

It was the first time Helmut saw such an admiring look in Charlotte’s eyes. She was determined like a model student.

‘As a fellow Greta student, I should strive to compete with Senior Helmut.’

Charlotte’s tournament was the next day.

Of course, Charlotte would only meet Helmut in the finals, and unless she competed in her best condition, her chances of reaching the finals were slim.

Charlotte was a first-year, and this tournament included up to third-year students.

No matter what resolution Charlotte held, it was irrelevant to Helmut.

Helmut only thought he must get eliminated next time.

‘Next time…’

He felt that more proactive measures would be needed to ensure his elimination, rather than half-hearted attempts.

That day, trouble inevitably came from Matesis. It wasn’t a formal complaint, just trouble.

A Matesis instructor, who Helmut encountered while passing by, couldn’t hide his anger and threw a criticism at Instructor Patricia.

“Your student is nothing but a hooligan. I’m questioning the education at Greta Academy. How can he pull such a stunt in a legitimate duel? Who is this Helmut anyway?”

Everyone who watched knew that Helmut had intentionally beaten his opponent. That was the point being criticized.

Instructor Patricia scoffed and retorted.

“What can we do if our student’s skill is overwhelmingly superior to yours? Winning without even drawing the sword in a duel. You should strive harder!”

The Matesis instructor couldn’t respond and stormed off.

Feeling triumphant, Instructor Patricia came to the training ground and silently patted Helmut’s shoulder.

Helmut looked at her puzzled.

“Instructor?”

Instructor Patricia suddenly frowned and, placing her hand on his shoulder, asked worriedly.

“Was your condition bad? I didn’t expect you to hit your opponent with the scabbard.”

“Maybe.”

Did the instructor think he shouldn’t have done that? There was a certain dignity expected of Greta Academy students.

Helmut thought it was better to say he was feeling unwell.

However, Instructor Patricia didn’t criticize him at all.

“Anyway, well done. You did great. If that’s how well you perform when you’re unwell, there’s nothing to worry about. The championship is yours, Helmut!”

She smiled with satisfaction. After advising him not to overdo it and to recover his condition, she left.

After she left, Helmut felt a heavy weight on his mind. Any excuse wouldn’t work anymore.

Unless he feigned a high fever, Helmut didn’t know how to naturally get eliminated.

That night, Alea nodded when she heard the news that Helmut couldn’t get eliminated.

“I expected as much.”

Helmut didn’t have a talent for this sort of thing.

In other words, he was bad at pretending to be sick or such.

It seemed Alea had also been thinking about it because she soon spoke again.

“I have a good idea. The day after tomorrow is your next match, right? Leave the dormitory that morning.”

“Leave?”

“Yes, head towards Baden. We stay in contact through our bracelets, right? Say you got a signal and thought I was in danger. But it turned out to be a misunderstanding. I made a mistake.

You only realize this while heading towards Baden and return by evening. If I contact the faculty, it will seem more natural.”

“Isn’t it a stretch for me to rush out thinking you were in danger when you’re at the academy?”

There was still the issue of the final exams. Alea seemed relaxed, but she was studying until dawn.

Still, she had enough time to contact Helmut in between studying.

In fact, studying was just a habit for Alea – she had already finished preparing for the exams.

“Just say you couldn’t think that far. It seemed urgent, so you ran out with your sword.”

Helmut raised an eyebrow.

“That’s a bit forced.”

Giving her every benefit of the doubt, even if his girlfriend was in danger, would he really ignore the swordsmanship tournament, not even leave word with the instructors, and just rush out with only his sword?

However, he cannot simply disappear like that just because a friend might be in danger, without knowing the full situation.

That would cause unnecessary misunderstandings, like Helmut and Alea having some secret relationship.

No matter how close friends they are, that would be going a bit too far.



H.F.C Chapter 226 (Part 2):

`				`It was an issue arising from the fact that only the dean knew Alea was disguised as a man.

Helmut pointed out one fact.

“Professor Luxen can track me.”

A magic department professor could do that. He had been keeping a close eye on Helmut lately.

He even volunteered to watch the lower-year swordsmanship tournament.

If Helmut disappeared, he would be the first to know.

He might even be monitoring him now, sensing Helmut wanted to get eliminated from the tournament.

“Then, do you have a plan?”

Alea asked with a sigh. Helmut gave a predictable answer.

“I’ll figure something out.”

He had to make a decision on his own now.

\*

The next day was Charlotte’s tournament.

It was uncertain whether she would advance to the next stage.

Her opponent was said to be a second-year from the Imperial Academy. Being selected as a representative meant he was likely the top student of his year.

‘They will all be tough opponents for me.’

Charlotte, who had diligently trained in the familiar air of Ratona, felt confident.

‘Alright.’

She wasn’t sure if her mother would be watching, but she intended to do her best. Her eyes gleamed with determination.

Charlotte tied her long hair tightly. It was almost time for her match.

Meanwhile, Michael was ill. Of course, he was often sick, so it wasn’t unusual.

Michael no longer cursed his frail body as he used to.

But it was still frustrating when his body didn’t cooperate.

‘I’ve prepared for this tournament and now I can’t watch it.’

A bitter smile appeared on Michael’s lips, who had been bedridden for days.

His condition had improved, but moving around was still too much. It seemed he was being punished for treating Charlotte poorly.

Whenever he had conflicts with Charlotte, Michael would always fall ill.

As twins, Michael and Charlotte were connected in some way, causing such effects.

Yet, Michael couldn’t help but bother Charlotte.

‘Today is the day Charlotte competes.’

Michael furrowed his brow. Pushing himself to get up would worsen his condition.

But Charlotte might get eliminated today.

She was still a first-year, too young to achieve notable results in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Even though she had been trained by the commander of the Black Wing Knights and was a talented student at Greta Academy.

All participants in this tournament were so-called geniuses.

So this might be the first and last chance for him to see her compete in the tournament he organized.

‘Do I want Charlotte to get eliminated?’

In the past, he would have been consumed by jealousy, hoping for her elimination.

But now, it wasn’t quite the same. Time apart seemed to have had a healing effect. Michael pondered.

“Michael, are you feeling any better?”

A worried voice came. The only person who could enter his room without permission.

Michael looked up. An elegant blonde noblewoman was looking down at him.

“Mother.”

“I heard your fever has gone down… but you still can’t get up. This bout of flu has been quite severe.”

Michael closed his eyes and smiled gently.

“Please keep your distance. I wouldn’t want you catching my flu.”

“I rarely get the flu, you know.”

“Indeed.”

Surprisingly, Michael was the only weak one in the Renosa family.

Even his mother, who didn’t wield a sword, was very healthy.

That was why Michael had felt extreme deprivation. The whole family was healthy and strong, but he was frail alone.

“What a shame. You love swordsmanship tournaments. You must be disappointed not to watch it.”

He had the privilege of watching the matches from the best seat as the host.

But it was meaningless if his body couldn’t keep up.

“Yes, it’s a shame.”

Michael suddenly had a good idea.

“Today is Charlotte’s match. Could you watch it on my behalf?”

“Are you sure that’s alright?”

In fact, the Grand Duchess of Renosa knew Michael was jealous of Charlotte.

She looked at him with surprised eyes.

“Yes, of course. Charlotte will be happy to see you.”

“I’m glad you’re thinking of Charlotte. She will appreciate it.”

If Charlotte knew Michael sent her, she wouldn’t be so pleased. She would be suspicious of his intentions.

But she would be happy to see their mother watching her.

‘Although she probably wouldn’t want to be eliminated in front of Mother… I wonder how it will turn out.’

While harboring mischievous thoughts, Michael still spoke with an angelic expression.

“That’s fortunate. Just watch from a distance. Charlotte doesn’t want her identity revealed.”

“Of course. I’ll be careful.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa gave Michael warm tea and medicine before leaving gracefully.

She was heading straight to the tournament hall.



H.F.C Chapter 227 (Part 1):

`				`The Grand Duchess of Renosa was an impeccable noblewoman.

With her blonde hair and blue eyes, she was a beauty with an air of grace and sophistication, hailing from one of the most prestigious noble families in the empire.

A fitting partner for the Grand Duke of Renosa, who carried the royal bloodline.

Although she did not enjoy public engagements, the Grand Duchess supported the Grand Duke quietly from behind the scenes.

Even the cold-hearted Grand Duke of Renosa cherished her deeply.

The fact that the Grand Duchess favored Michael wasn’t an issue. She never openly supported Michael in the succession competition, maintaining a certain level of neutrality.

It was only natural for a mother to be particularly concerned about her frail young son, who seemed to be at death’s door.

Some merely found this bias unfortunate.

\*

Before the tournament began, Charlotte frowned upon meeting someone.

“It’s troublesome if you visit me like this.”

She had been called to a nearby room after entering the waiting room.

There, Charlotte encountered a familiar face.

Alonso, the commander of the Black Wing Knights.

His piercing eyes shone beneath his hood. Dressed not in armor or the Knights’ uniform, but in noble attire with his hood pulled low, he radiated an aura that couldn’t be underestimated.

No one could instinctively look down on him. His presence alone confirmed his identity as the commander of the Black Wing Knights.

He smiled at the young grand duchess.

“I’m on vacation. I didn’t come to see Lady Charlotte. I came to see my disciple, Charlotte.”

Despite this, he showed due respect.

“I was careful not to be detected. Don’t worry. But it seems you’re not pleased to see me.”

Only then did Charlotte’s face brighten.

“I’m glad you came.”

“Do you have confidence in winning?”

“I want to win.”

“You seem confident. Your eyes are sharp.”

“I don’t know how far I’ll go, but I’ve been lucky so far. I believe I can at least advance to the next stage.”

Charlotte awkwardly smiled. She wasn’t used to openly speaking about underestimating her opponents.

Alonso responded leisurely.

“It’s fine. As long as you’re not complacent. By the way, I heard His Highness Michael visited you… How was it?”

Alonso scrutinized Charlotte’s face.

“We exchanged greetings well.”

Charlotte succinctly ended the conversation.

Even though Alonso was her master and a retainer of the grand ducal house, it wasn’t wise to expose family matters. In this regard, Charlotte was every bit the great noblewoman.

Charlotte’s gaze was firm, unwavering. Alonso spoke after a moment.

“…I was going to mention it, but I suppose it’s better this way.”

“What is it?”

“The Grand Duchess has come to the arena. Probably to watch her daughter’s match.”

“My mother?”

Charlotte’s eyes widened.

She had assumed Michael was unwell and wouldn’t appear at the tournament.

When Michael was sick, the Grand Duchess’s attention was entirely on him.

She didn’t expect her mother to be interested in her match, believing she wouldn’t even look at her matches on the bracket.

“She doesn’t usually enjoy these kinds of tournaments, so she must have come to see your match. Do you feel motivated?”

“Yes.”

Alonso looked at Charlotte with a pitying gaze as her face lit up.

After a few more words, Alonso was the first to bid farewell.

“Then I’ll be off. I wish you the best of luck.”

“Thank you for coming, Master.”

As soon as he left, Charlotte sighed as she returned to the waiting room.

She wondered what Michael would do if he found out about this.

‘It should be fine. He must have acted discreetly.’

Even Michael couldn’t track every move of the Black Wing Knight commander, especially since he was currently bedridden.

Charlotte found solace in knowing that someone in Ratona prioritized her over Michael.

The problem was that person happened to be the Black Wing Knight commander. The fact that he was on her side was significant.

But no one could harm or pressure Alonso.

In Renosa, if not as much as the commander of the Palma Knights in Basor, the Black Wing Knight commander held a formidable presence.

Even Michael wouldn’t dare lay a hand on him.

‘For now, I need to focus on today’s tournament.’

Though confident, her opponent was no pushover. She couldn’t afford to be distracted.

Charlotte steeled herself.



H.F.C Chapter 227 (Part 2):

`				`Waaaah—!

Amidst the thunderous cheers, two selected participants stepped onto the stage.

One was a slender girl with black hair.

Her face bore some resemblance to the Grand Duke, but few in the arena had seen the Grand Duke of Renosa, so her identity wasn’t questioned.

‘There seem to be more people here than during my match.’

Helmut glanced around.

He had thought he could leisurely watch the tournament, but that seemed unlikely.

Unlike yesterday, the stands were quite full.

Many who failed to get tickets for the senior matches had obtained tickets for the junior matches, but today’s matchups were particularly interesting.

Charlotte. She was the only female among the selected participants.

Her presence had garnered much attention since before the tournament began.

Helmut wasn’t particularly interested in Charlotte’s match.

It would be preferable if she didn’t get eliminated, but even if she did, it wouldn’t matter much to him.

Helmut’s reason for being here wasn’t to scout his competitors.

It was a sudden impulse to watch a swordsmanship tournament from the audience’s perspective. He had always been a participant, never having sat in the stands.

He also wanted to see who watched these matches, especially the high-ranking individuals in the best seats.

Fortunately, most of the spectators didn’t recognize him, and those who did merely glanced his way without approaching, allowing him some peace.

Not having any special privileges as a selected participant, Helmut had to purchase a ticket at full price.

Nevertheless, he succeeded in securing a decent spot to watch the tournament.

‘I only need to watch Charlotte’s match.’

For a while, he wouldn’t have to think about how to get eliminated.

Helmut still hadn’t found an answer to that problem.

Though some might recognize Charlotte, many high-ranking nobles filled the best seats.

Helmut focused his gaze on the highest, shaded seats.

He sensed a concentration of skilled knights there.

Helmut narrowed his eyes.

‘Is there a high-ranking noble up there? I can’t see.’

Even with good eyesight, it’s hard to see from below unless the angle is right. Not unless the person reveals themselves.

They seemed to be hiding due to potential assassination attempts, making it hard to identify them.

‘No rush.’

He wasn’t expecting much anyway. Helmut decided to watch the match calmly.

Soon, the match began.

- Booooong!

Charlotte had certainly improved her skills. Helmut could feel it.

Though he usually paid no attention to others’ skills, Charlotte was different.

She was diligent, treated him as a senior, was presumed to be related by blood, and they had exchanged quite a few words. They were relatively close.

He had enough interest to compare her current achievements to the past. Helmut realized anew.

‘Even if we’re not related by blood, I might hesitate to kill her if she became an enemy.’

Charlotte was one of the few who gave him such a feeling.

Helmut watched Charlotte’s match closely.

This time, her opponent was challenging. Not a large, clumsy one, but a small, agile one.

The opponent was stronger than Charlotte. But Helmut didn’t feel like she would lose.

Though it wouldn’t be easy, she would win if she didn’t lose focus. But since they were using real swords, there was a risk of injury.

And then it happened.

Charlotte deliberately created an opening, and her opponent’s sword rushed in.

Blood trickled down Charlotte’s cheek. But in exchange for that small wound, she thrust her sword under her opponent’s neck.

“Charlotte, wins!”

The arena echoed with thunderous cheers. Charlotte calmly wiped the flowing blood.

The wound would heal without a trace after receiving healing magic.

In the midst of the deafening noise, Helmut sensed a commotion above and looked up.

And he saw her. A blonde woman leaning over the edge with a shocked expression.

Even from a distance, her figure stood out clearly against the railing.

‘That woman is….’

It was like a lightning bolt. His heart momentarily froze and then beat rapidly.

Something growled inside him, like a solid rock beginning to roll.

Helmut instantly recognized her. It was instinctual.

A distant memory etched in his mind surged up.

‘Helmut!’

The cry resonated vividly in his ears. Helmut stood up abruptly.

But his legs wouldn’t move. He just stood there.

Despite the shock, he knew he couldn’t go to her.

Helmut just stared at the blonde woman.

A complaint soon came from behind.

“Hey, what are you doing standing there? Sit down, I can’t see.”

“Who is that woman?”

Helmut asked.

The man who had spoken was about to get angry, but he calmed down upon receiving Helmut’s fierce gaze.

‘This kid, his eyes look like he just killed several people!’

“Which woman?”

“The one standing at the top, by the railing. Is she a noble?”

Squinting, the man looked in the direction Helmut indicated and spoke.

“If you mean that woman, she seems to be the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Probably. I heard the nobles gossiping about her being here. She must be startled by the girl bleeding. They say she’s a beauty, and indeed, she is!”

“The Grand Duchess…of Renosa?”

Helmut repeated the title the man spoke.

He had never felt his mind go blank like this. He couldn’t remember what to do.

Helmut recognized her. His mother. The reason he wanted to leave the Forest of Roots.

But then what?

The blonde woman soon turned back towards the shaded area, led by others.

Because Charlotte had left the stage to receive treatment.

As she kept looking back at the stage, her gaze suddenly shifted. As if sensing someone watching her.

She looked toward where Helmut was standing in the audience.

She seemed to freeze, having discovered something.

Clear blue eyes and dark eyes met in a straight line.

For a moment, it felt like their eyes met.



H.F.C Chapter 228 (Part 1):

`				`However, she turned away. Her movement was so smooth that it felt like the brief pause had been an illusion.

Surrounded by knights, the lady disappeared into the shade without hesitation.

It felt as though something had been dug out from inside him. A sense of regret stabbed at his heart.

‘There’s no way she saw me…right?’

She had merely glanced down at the spectators.

Many people here had been looking at her. Could she really have seen him clearly from this distance with normal eyesight?

Helmut was merely a boy with black hair who resembled her forsaken son, a boy she might have completely forgotten by now.

A joke was thrown from behind.

“Fell for her, didn’t you? She’s quite a beauty. But no matter how beautiful, a kid like you shouldn’t be coveting a married woman… Hik!”

The man who made the joke gasped as he met Helmut’s pitch-black pupils and leaned back, startled.

Helmut did not punish him. There was no point in staying here any longer.

He moved his gaze, took one last look at the shaded area, and then left the place.

“What was that…?”

The Duchess of Renosa mumbled as she looked back at the railing. Her mind was restless.

What she saw…

A worried expression appeared on the lady’s face. The maid sitting next to her offered words of comfort.

“You must be worried. It seems Her Highness bled a bit… but they say it’s a minor accident for a swordsmanship tournament. She’ll be fine after receiving treatment.”

“Ah, yes, you’re right.”

Lost in thought, she snapped back to her senses. Charlotte.

The Duchess of Renosa had come to see her daughter at this swordsmanship tournament.

While watching the match, Charlotte had suddenly bled… Although she seemed to have won, the surprised Duchess had rushed to the railing to look down.

And then, she felt a piercing gaze.

She had instinctively turned towards the gaze.

Though she was accustomed to being stared at, this kind of look was unfamiliar.

The other person seemed to be a boy, about Charlotte’s age.

Black hair, black eyes. The boy with familiar colors looked somehow familiar to her.

A sharp, fleeting pain shot through her like a flash.

But above all, his gaze…

‘He looks like him…’

The Duchess of Renosa, Margret, was startled by her own thoughts.

A distant memory, buried deep within the lake of her memories, surfaced. It was a memory buried very deep.

It was easy to forget since it wasn’t really a memory, but she hadn’t forgotten.

Because, to parents, children are like that.

Margret closed her eyes slowly and then opened them. Her breath, which had quickened momentarily, returned to normal.

‘There’s no way… He’s dead.’

The maid draped a shawl over her shoulders and suggested.

“You should go see Her Highness Charlotte. She’ll be waiting in the room prepared separately.”

“Ah, yes. I should… go see her.”

Margret calmed her mind again. Her worry for Charlotte resurfaced.

“Let’s go quickly.”

“Yes, Your Grace.”

\*

The door opened, and a beautiful lady stepped inside.

Seeing her, Charlotte hurriedly stood up from her seat.

“Mother.”

“Yes, Charlotte. Are you alright?”

“I’ve been treated, so I’m fine now.”

Although the wound on her cheek had already healed, Margret stroked the spot tenderly.

Charlotte was perfectly fine. She was a bit tired, but she felt good.

Her mother had come to see her, and she had secured her advancement to the second round.

But Margret’s expression did not soften.

“I knew swordsmanship tournaments were rough, but watching it in person is truly nerve-wracking. You could have died.”

“I won’t die. The stage is prepared for accidents.”

Charlotte smiled calmly.

Even so, one couldn’t immediately block a descending sword, but as long as she was breathing, she could be saved.

If one thought about such dangers and got scared, they couldn’t be a swordsman. Charlotte was a swordsman.

“It’s impressive that you swing your sword without blinking in such a place. I couldn’t even see how you moved properly.”

Her mother seemed to see Charlotte in a new light.

To her, Charlotte had just been a young daughter who knew how to handle a sword a bit.

“I’ve been handling swords since I was young. It’s familiar to me.”

“Still, be careful. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have taught you the sword…”

Margret spoke wishfully. As a member of the Renosa duchy, Charlotte had to learn the sword.

Even Michael had learned a bit of swordsmanship. Though he had to stop because he fell ill.

“I like swords. You don’t need to worry. I’m careful enough not to get hurt.”

“You should be. I’m proud of you for showing such excellent performance as a representative of the academy, even though you’re only a first-year.”

“Thank you.”

Margret patted Charlotte’s shoulder. Charlotte felt good being recognized.

Even if her mother being here was Michael’s doing, it was still something.

She was still young and craved her mother’s attention.



H.F.C Chapter 228 (Part 2):

`				`“How was the tournament venue? Was it comfortable to watch?”

“Yes, it was. It was in full view. Normally, Michael would have attended, but he’s ill… He told me about your match. He’s been thinking a lot about you lately.”

Margret spoke softly, as if encouraging reconciliation.

“I hope Michael gets well soon. Unfortunately, I can’t visit him.”

Charlotte responded calmly. It wasn’t just because she was participating in the tournament.

Michael disliked it very much when Charlotte visited him while he was ill. He probably felt inferior.

Charlotte quickly changed the subject.

“Has anything special happened? Did you see anything unusual? It’s been a while since you came to watch a swordsmanship tournament, hasn’t it?”

“Yes, it has. Something unusual…”

Margret’s eyes narrowed. She spoke, shaking off her heavy heart.

“I saw a boy with black hair in the audience. I couldn’t see his face well, but he seemed to be about your age. He had black hair and black eyes like the Duke. Really, as dark as the abyss.”

Margret thought the boy also resembled Charlotte. Charlotte tilted her head.

“Could it be senior Helmut? He might have come to watch since he doesn’t have a match today.”

“Helmut… you say?”

Margret’s hand twitched. Charlotte didn’t notice her reaction.

“Do you remember? I think I mentioned it during the vacation. He’s a senior, a year above me, and a commoner with exceptional skills… Though he’s said to be a commoner, I suspect he might be a distant relative of our family. He might have inherited the blood of Renosa in some distant way.”

“Why do you think so?”

“I heard some people say he resembles me.”

To say that the daughter of the Duchess of Renosa resembled a mere commoner would be enough to warrant execution outside the academy.

But the academy students didn’t know Charlotte’s true identity. They spoke without hesitation.

They, too, were mostly nobles, so they felt no restraint.

“Really? They say you resemble a commoner.”

Margret frowned. She had lived her entire life as a high-ranking noble.

Even if she didn’t despise commoners, she had never considered herself equal to them.

“Still, I think we look quite alike. They say we look like siblings when we stand side by side.”

Charlotte felt a vague sense of closeness to Helmut. Despite his cold and somewhat eerie impression.

Charlotte thought it was probably because she and Helmut looked alike.

“Do you really resemble each other that much…”

Margret trailed off. Charlotte resembled her father. That meant she resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa.

That boy named Helmut must also resemble the Grand Duke of Renosa.

Charlotte spoke without much thought, but it was a situation that could raise suspicions of illegitimacy.

But Margret didn’t consider such doubts. She gently pressed her temples.

Her insides felt hot. Margret couldn’t resist the turmoil rising within her heart.

‘It doesn’t make sense.’

It was an impossible situation. But what was this feeling? Sometimes, there are things that cannot be explained by words.

It was an inexplicable force that couldn’t be ignored as if nothing had happened.

Noticing Margret’s distress, Charlotte quickly added.

“Don’t think too much about it. It’s just my guess. I’ve heard that senior isn’t from Renosa or the empire.”

The Grand Duke of Renosa hadn’t left the empire or Renosa in the past 15 years.

Moreover, if it were the Grand Duke, he would have treated his illegitimate child decently or taken care of him completely.

He wouldn’t have left his illegitimate child to grow up secretly as a commoner.

“Is that Helmut boy really that skilled? For you to be so interested.”

“Yes, I can assure you it would be strange if senior Helmut didn’t win this tournament. He’s a senior I can learn a lot from as a fellow swordsman.”

“I see… interesting.”

Margret responded with a squint. Her confusion was gradually clearing up.

She just hadn’t known what to do. Now she knew what to do.

‘I need to meet him.’

Margret decided. Charlotte, thinking her mother was starting to take an interest in Helmut, quickly continued.

“Senior has advanced to the second round, so he has a match tomorrow. Though it will be over quickly. Senior Helmut doesn’t like to drag things out.”

Even if he didn’t join the Black Wing Knights, it wouldn’t hurt to impress the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Charlotte thought positively.

“Hmm. I understand.”

Margret replied, speaking slowly after a moment.

“I’ll have to watch him.”

“Won’t the Grand Duke be attending?”

The Grand Duke was interested in swordsmanship tournaments, unlike Margret. He was a swordsman himself.

“The Grand Duke has left Ratona for some business. He won’t be back for a while.”

“I see.”

Charlotte didn’t ask further.

The only one who could ask beyond that was the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Here was simply Charlotte, Greta Academy’s representative.

“Then you should go rest.”

“I’ll see you from a distance tomorrow.”

“Come back to the palace as soon as the tournament is over.”

“Yes, mother.”

The conversation ended with smiles. But the confusion from the new information was just beginning.

Watching Charlotte leave the room with a bright face, Margret placed a hand on her chest.

Her heart was pounding. She hoped to find out the reason for this throbbing.

The dead cannot return.

But Margret needed to confirm it.

‘Confirm it and…’

What would happen next was still unknown.



H.F.C Chapter 229 (Part 1):

`				`Helmut returned to the lodge and swung his sword. He was so focused that he hardly heard anyone trying to talk to him.

Swinging his sword like this allowed Helmut to forget many things.

Problems he didn’t know how to solve.

His sword was clear and produced the desired result.

But life wasn’t like that. Choices weren’t either.

So far, Helmut had made pretty good choices. Could he continue to do so in the future?

Helmut felt himself weakening in the face of what he desired most. Confusion.

It was a human trait he didn’t know he possessed.

‘Grand Duchess of Renosa.’

Helmut saw the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

And he was certain. She was the woman from his long-ago memories.

Mother. Despite the long years, her appearance hadn’t changed much. Could his memory be mistaken?

Could he be deluding himself due to his longing to find his mother?

Helmut was sure, but he needed more certainty.

He had to meet her.

But continuing the expedition like this was dangerous.

Even the bold Alea, who said one must take risks when necessary, had warned him several times.

Helmut looked down at the sword he had just become familiar with.

Countless thoughts crossed his mind, but they soon converged into one.

Nothing could be decided before tomorrow.

Helmut would face that tomorrow.

\*

On the second day, after the first round, the competitive structure of the three academies in Baden became clear.

All selected members of Greta Academy advanced to the second round.

Two selected members of Loen Academy were eliminated, and two advanced.

One selected member of Matesis Academy was eliminated, and three advanced.

Contrary to expectations, Greta Academy, which was looked down upon the most, achieved the best results, causing the instructors of the other academies to look displeased.

But skill is undeniable.

Helmut’s skill, especially in brutally defeating Taren, the winning candidate from Matesis Academy, was undeniable.

Students or not, instructors had to have at least that much sense of reality.

The atmosphere at the lodge changed slightly. Originally distant from Greta Academy, Loen and Matesis seemed to be banding together to exclude Greta.

It seemed they had developed a grudge against Greta Academy for no particular reason.

Instructors Patricia and Alan exchanged a few words.

“What’s this atmosphere? They’re only whispering among themselves, and it’s not pleasant.”

“Don’t worry about it. After all, Matesis and Loen are close to each other and have frequent exchanges even in Baden.”

“Looks like Matesis will only duel with Loen from now on?”

“Doesn’t matter. Anyway, the championship will be ours, Greta’s.”

“Ah yes, indeed.”

Instructor Patricia smiled brightly. The atmosphere among the faculty was most relaxed at Greta Academy.

Perhaps the experience of dueling with the unique Charlotte had helped, as the sixth-year Nils also showed noticeable improvement.

Leon, who had seemed listless after losing to Helmut, was back on track.

After facing opponents in the first round, they seemed insignificant compared to Helmut. Helmut was exceptionally outstanding.

Leon was still strong and a championship candidate. However, despite regaining his confidence, he still avoided Helmut.

It was due to an inexplicable fear that remained.

And another one, Taren from Matesis Academy, had a reason to avoid Helmut.

Those who were eliminated had the freedom to pack up and leave or stay. Some, having come to Renosa, intended to visit the beautiful city of Ratona.

But Taren, who was eliminated because of Helmut, quickly packed his things and left the quarters.

Of course, this was permitted by the instructors. The absence of one person wasn’t noticeable.

Everyone was focused on training to achieve good results in the tournament.

On the first day of the second round, before leaving the quarters, Helmut was held by the instructors and received a few words of encouragement. Mostly, it was along the lines of trusting him.

No one tried to give Helmut advice. The instructors knew he was someone who didn’t need advice.

Just as he was about to leave, Charlotte appeared and quickly spoke to him.

“Senior, you came to the arena yesterday, right?”

“Yes, I watched your match.”

Helmut gave Charlotte his attention. He had a guess why the Grand Duchess of Renosa was there.

It wasn’t out of curiosity about the female participants but to watch Charlotte’s match.

For her to cling to the railing after seeing the bleeding from Charlotte’s cheek, they must be very close.

In other words, as he guessed, Charlotte was his younger sister.

She seemed closer to that than being his brother’s fiancée. Helmut and Charlotte looked alike.

“I knew it. Someone said they saw you.”

Charlotte hesitated for some reason. She had tried to talk to Helmut yesterday too.

But she withdrew when she noticed his intense demeanor, likely due to the tournament occupying his mind. It wasn’t an urgent matter anyway.

Helmut asked subtly. For some reason, his question felt heavy as it left his lips.

“Someone saw me?”

“Someone close to me. They might come to watch the tournament today too. If there’s a chance, I’d like to introduce you later.”

Charlotte hadn’t forgotten that Helmut mentioned Margret’s maiden name.

But she didn’t know what it meant.

What mattered to Charlotte now was the second round. She had no time to think about anything else.

‘If Senior Helmut sees Mother, will he recognize her? Did he perhaps like her in the past?’

That was all she thought. Helmut remained expressionless.

After dropping the hint, Charlotte stepped back. Helmut glanced at her briefly before boarding the carriage.

Though he looked calm, his heart was racing.

‘Today… she’s coming to watch the tournament.’

An unexpected situation had found him again. His steps wavered slightly as he boarded the carriage.



H.F.C Chapter 229 (Part 2):

`				`The arena was particularly noisy today. It was because of a rare distinguished guest.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa. Her visit had now become official.

Rumors spread through the mouths of those who glimpsed her as she got out of the carriage.

An elegant lady with impressive blonde hair. Her appearance was unmistakable.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa was highly popular among the principality’s people.

She was the ideal queen everyone thought of, the center of Ratona’s social circles.

Although she didn’t enjoy public activities, even her quiet nature was highly regarded.

The audience buzzed among themselves.

“Look up there. They say the Grand Duchess of Renosa is inside where those knights are standing.”

“The Grand Duchess of Renosa? Unexpected. I heard she’s not one to attend such events.”

“And it’s not even a senior match. Why would she come to watch the junior match?”

“Maybe because there’s relatively less audience, she decided to help with the tournament’s popularity? After all, this tournament is organized by the Grand Duchy of Renosa.”

“I heard the tickets sold like hotcakes once it was rumored she’d attend. But what’s the point? It’s not like she’ll wave to us from the railing.”

“Look at that awning. There’s no way she’d show herself outside. She’ll watch the match quietly from inside.”

“They say she showed herself yesterday. Maybe she was surprised because that girl Charlotte got hurt.”

“Really? Then we might see her today too?”

“Is there an exciting match today that would interest the Grand Duchess?”

“Well, there’s that handsome guy Helmut’s match, isn’t he rumored to be the tournament favorite?”

“He beat his opponent with just the sword sheath? Completely toyed with him?”

“That’s something. It’s worth looking forward to. Junior matches are usually dull compared to senior matches.”

“They end quickly, that’s the problem. Can’t get our money’s worth for the tickets.”

“That’s true.”

Laughter erupted among them.

It was almost time for the match to start.

The audience was abuzz to the point of being headache-inducing.

Surrounded by noise, the Grand Duchess of Renosa held her forehead.

Her elegantly styled blonde hair shone brilliantly today as well.

A maid brought out warm tea and spoke worriedly.

“Do you have a headache? People rushed to buy tickets and filled the stands upon hearing you were coming.”

“Really? If many came to see me, I should greet them.”

“You don’t have to. You should take care of yourself.”

“I’m not sick. Just a bit…”

Margret frowned. Anxiety and tension rose, making her chest feel heavy.

The closer it got to the start of the match, the more so.

The stage was more visible from here than from the stands. A chance to see that boy from yesterday more closely. Even if from quite a distance.

“Is it still far from starting?”

“Oh, it’s starting soon. Look, Your Grace, the participants are coming up.”

Margret looked down at the stage. A sturdy boy with brown hair went up first, and across from him…

She saw a boy.

Black hair like crow feathers. Deep, striking black eyes. A boy with pale skin.

Margret immediately knew. He was the boy from yesterday.

‘Helmut…’

Margret bit her lip. She knew that name all too well.

It was the name given to her first child.

A child who left his mother’s embrace to die before he could truly live in this world.

A child she had no choice but to abandon.

If her first son Helmut had grown up, he would have grown like that boy.

But he died in the Forest of Roots and could never come back.

Margret had buried that child in her heart.

But now, here was a boy the same age, with the same name, and even a similar appearance. Was this a coincidence?

Margret involuntarily sighed.

“He resembles…”

The maid cautiously responded.

“Indeed, he looks a lot like Your Grace’s family… Could he be a distant relative of the Grand Ducal family?”

Perhaps she thought Helmut resembled the Grand Duke.

Helmut’s existence was buried in darkness. Few in the Grand Duchy knew about it.

Those who knew thought Margret’s first child was stillborn.

It wasn’t entirely a lie. Her first child wasn’t born dead but died after birth.

Margret slowly closed and opened her eyes. Her lips parted.

“Before it starts, I should greet them.”



H.F.C Chapter 230 (Part 1):

`				`“Look over there! The Grand Duchess is coming out.”

The audience stands instantly buzzed with excitement. A dignified blonde noblewoman walked out from under the canopy.

It was Margret, the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Her rare public appearances made her presence even more noteworthy on such an official occasion.

With a gentle smile, she elegantly waved at the crowd. The audience responded with loud applause and cheers.

The knights guarding the Grand Duchess were tense, ready for any unexpected incidents.

Her gaze naturally shifted downward to the arena below.

Two young boys were standing there, about to begin their match.

Their eyes met simultaneously. The two participants of the swordsmanship contest looked up at the Grand Duchess.

One quickly realized his rudeness, lowered his head, and bowed like a knight, but the other did not.

The boy with black hair stared boldly up at her without concern for manners.

His eyes were as dark as raven feathers, intense and seemingly swallowed by darkness.

Their gazes met again, closer than before.

To the Grand Duchess standing at the railing, the presence of that boy filled the empty stage entirely.

Her eyes trembled slightly as she scanned his face.

He bore a striking resemblance. To the Grand Duke, to Charlotte, and to that baby.

Margret had once imagined what that child would look like when he grew up.

The boy named Helmut looked exactly like that image. It was astonishing, so perfect that it seemed impossible he wasn’t the same person.

‘If that child had grown up, he would look like this.’

Her eyes stung and her chest ached. She couldn’t understand anymore.

Her child was dead. A dead child could not come back to life, yet Margret felt as if her dead child had returned.

She felt strange about herself. However, Margret’s turmoil did not show any further.

With a smile befitting the Grand Duchess of Renosa, she looked down and then turned away.

As she disappeared into the canopy, the conversation about her subsided quickly.

The arena soon regained its previous atmosphere.

Helmut slowly closed and opened his eyes.

It was her. No doubt. He had found her. His heart trembled.

He felt as if he had finally come home. Every cell in his body felt alive.

A shout came from the side.

“We’re starting soon. Get ready!”

His opponent looked like just another obstacle to be crushed.

But he knew he couldn’t kill him. He clung to that single thread of awareness.

This was Renosa, and his mother was watching.

Helmut, who had been contemplating how to lose naturally, had gone.

Defeat was not a word he could accept.

It was an absolute pull and will that couldn’t be reasoned with.

Whether it was the temple or anything else, it didn’t matter. There were moments when it was inevitable.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa had come to this swordsmanship tournament.

His mother was watching.

He couldn’t show her defeat. Never.

A flash of determination crossed Helmut’s eyes.

The next moment, his will was expressed through his sword.

Clang! The sword slipped out of his opponent’s grasp and clattered pathetically to the ground.

His opponent’s widened pupils reflected confusion and incomprehension.

Then, seeing his fallen sword, his eyes filled with despair.

What followed was fear.

This was a real fight. If this had been a battlefield, he would not have survived.

Not only had his opponent disarmed him, but he would have also slit his throat.

The black-haired boy’s cold gaze and unhesitating sword were enough to evoke primal fear.

It was like standing before the Grim Reaper.

‘W-What kind of guy is this?’

Could an academy student possibly display such prowess?

His opponent wondered. He, too, had won far more battles than he had lost and was regarded as one of the best of his age.

But evaluations and talent aside, the boy in front of him was different.

He was no longer just an unpolished gem in the making.

Academy students were incomplete, constantly being hammered and refined into swords.

But Helmut was already a sword.

There were very few who could be described as swords themselves. No, extremely few.

But one of those extremely few was here. In the form of a mere fifteen-year-old boy.

That vast and absolute presence. It made his opponent tremble with awe.

‘How… can such a young boy…’

But he acknowledged his defeat. He couldn’t deny it. His opponent quickly accepted it.

While pondering the mystery of the boy named Helmut. The mystery was not his alone.

But in any case, Helmut had won. Again, as if it were familiar. Just as he had intended.

A different outcome would have been nearly miraculous from the start.



H.F.C Chapter 230 (Part 2):

`				`Helmut raised his head and looked at the audience with his black eyes.

His gaze, containing a hidden flame within the ice, seemed arrogant.

But the arrogance of a victor was natural. Even though this was not Basor but Renosa, at this moment, no one could deny Helmut.

Waaahhhh! Loud cheers strike the stage.

Again.

This time, he didn’t make the conspicuous move of striking his opponent with his sword sheath.

He simply swung his sword, disarmed his opponent, and pointed his sword at him.

His opponent stood helpless before him, as if stripped naked.

Helmut had made it so.

‘I must win.’

As if it were obvious, Helmut muttered to himself. He wanted to show it.

It wasn’t vanity or arrogance. Just as in Basor, he liked winning.

He liked the feeling of having his existence and strength acknowledged and confirmed.

The audience began cheering for him wildly, and that cheer would likely continue until Helmut was crowned champion.

And his mother was watching.

It felt like he had left the Forest of Roots for this moment. Perhaps that was indeed the truth.

Helmut’s gaze moved upward. The inside of the canopy was quiet.

But he felt a gaze directed at him from inside.

He couldn’t know what it was, but his mother was agitated.

Was she also instinctively feeling it?

If he won the swordsmanship contest, he might meet the members of the Grand Duchy.

His mother would probably be there. No, she definitely would be.

If she had seen Helmut, she would want to confirm it.

He didn’t know if he could reveal the truth.

But Helmut finally felt certain about what he needed to do.

He had to win.

Helmut bowed his head toward the Grand Duchess, as if apologizing for his earlier rudeness.

Applause poured out.

Margret clenched and unclenched her hands several times. Her gaze wandered anxiously in the air.

Even when Michael had collapsed, she had never felt such an emotional upheaval.

Since losing her first child fifteen years ago, she had lived quietly, like a calm lake, despite the despair, pain, and sorrow she had endured.

As the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

But now, a stone had been thrown into her lake.

A maid asked worriedly,

“Your Grace, why do you look so restless?”

The maid was concerned that the Grand Duchess might be shocked by doubts about the Grand Duke’s fidelity.

In Renosa, those who knew the Grand Duke’s face would start to harbor such suspicions one by one.

It was terrifying talent and skill for an ordinary commoner boy to possess.

Margret made up her mind and spoke.

“I must meet that boy.”

“Your Grace, shall I send someone to bring him here?”

But Margret shook her head firmly and stopped her.

“No! No. I cannot meet a tournament participant privately… That would not be proper.”

It was something she couldn’t tell anyone. Not even the absent Grand Duke.

It was a truth she couldn’t reveal to Michael or Charlotte.

They didn’t know how their eldest brother had died. They had only vaguely heard that there was a stillborn child.

Margret had never once let them see the grief she had experienced in the past.

Helmut had been buried and dead in her heart.

But it was as if a corpse had walked out of the grave, as if he had been pulled out of the tomb in her heart.

The lady-in-waiting gently suggested,

“Don’t worry, Your Grace. We can bring him secretly.”

“No… If someone were to see him, there would be unnecessary rumors. False rumors.”

She couldn’t act recklessly. Margret quickly came to a decision on what to do.

With a look befitting a wise Grand Duchess, she spoke.

“I must observe this tournament further.”

“I will clear your schedule.”

“Good, and… is Charlotte here? There are too many people in the audience.”

“I have kept track of Lady Charlotte’s whereabouts. Shall I call her over?”

“Yes, please do.”

Margret closed her eyes. Numerous emotions and anguish were etched on her elegant brow.

\*

“Isn’t he amazing? Senior Helmut.”

Charlotte, who had just been called, was excited. She spoke as if watching the exploits of a very close friend, her own brother.

Even if it had been Michael, she wouldn’t have reacted like this.

To Margret, Charlotte’s reaction felt surprisingly significant.

Margret spoke warmly but clearly, drawing a line.

“Yes, he is quite an impressive commoner for you to praise him so highly. To achieve victory with a single swing of his sword. It was impressive.”

“Mother, status doesn’t matter at the academy. Senior Helmut is a swordsman I respect.”

“Yes, I understand. You seem to be quite close with him.”

“Yes, we’ve dueled before and were in the same selection group.”

Charlotte nodded cheerfully. Margret naturally inquired,

“Then you must know him well. Could you tell me more about him?”

“So, Mother is interested in Senior Helmut too? Well, Senior Helmut…”

Charlotte chatted away about the rumors and academy life of Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 231 (Part 1):

`				`Charlotte didn’t know much about Helmut.

He was the top student in the second year of the swordsmanship department, extremely diligent, and of a cool-headed disposition, often silent. He was well-regarded by the instructors and was a central figure among his peers.

As she spoke these words, Charlotte saw Helmut in a new light.

Except for his surface-level status as a commoner, Helmut was nearly perfect. It was astonishingly refreshing.

However, she didn’t feel any particular thrill or attraction towards him.

Even as she listed his strengths that she was aware of, and even as she looked up to him and conversed with him, she felt that way.

This was something Charlotte, who had little interest in others, found oddly intriguing.

‘If I had to say, it’s a sense of familiarity… But why?’

Charlotte did not forget that they were senior and junior in the Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department, nor did she forget that she was the Duchess of Renosa.

Upon graduation, they would merely be a commoner and a noble. Therefore, it was strange to feel a sense of closeness.

Yet, Charlotte felt a natural ease in speaking to Helmut, a senior whom everyone else seemed to avoid. It came naturally.

‘Could it be that I like that senior?’

An absurd question popped into her mind. But it didn’t seem to be the case.

Charlotte had never felt her heart race when she looked at him.

In fact, she always felt calm when she was with him. Even more than with her brother, Michael.

“What’s wrong? Is there something else on your mind?”

“No, um, I think Helmut will win. Among the Greta Academy selected representatives, Helmut is the strongest. He’s strong enough to easily defeat the senior selected representatives.”

“That’s impressive at such a young age.”

Margaret nodded, looking complicated. But she asked calmly, not showing her true feelings.

“Do you know where he’s from or where he lived? He might be related to Rinosa.”

Charlotte’s thoughts did not reach the doubting of her father’s loyalty. She shook her head.

“I don’t know. Helmut doesn’t reveal much about himself. I’ve heard he was raised by a swordsman who was friends with Instructor Ethan. He seemed to have grown up in a remote place, not near Renosa.”

“I see.”

Margaret fell into deep thought. Charlotte found it novel to see her mother so attentive to her words.

Seeing Margaret show interest in Helmut, words naturally flowed from Charlotte’s mouth.

Charlotte wanted to impress her mother. She had always craved her mother’s affection, which had been focused on Michael. The words spilled out naturally.

“I don’t know if I should say this…”

She hadn’t thought about it because of the upcoming tournament, but it had once been a concern for her.

Helmut had acted secretive, making it uncomfortable to talk about it.

However, no matter how significant a secret was, one tends to spill everything in front of their mother.

After a brief hesitation, Charlotte spoke.

“Margaret Irene. Isn’t that your maiden name, Mother?”

“Yes, I am from the Irene Marquis family.”

“But… Helmut knew that name. Margaret Irene. He asked me if I knew that name.”

“…What?”

Margaret’s reaction was a beat late. Charlotte frowned slightly.

“But isn’t it strange? When you were in the County, Helmut hadn’t even been born yet. How does he know your maiden name when he doesn’t know you’re the Grand Duchess of Rinosa? He clearly told me, ‘I saw a lady like that by chance before, and you resemble her.'”

After a moment of silence, Charlotte spoke again.

“Did you ever leave Rinosa, Mother? Did you see him when you visited your hometown?”

“…I did visit my hometown once, but in secret, and I didn’t go out.”

“Then how… Has he been to Renosa? How does he know your maiden name?”

The questions grew more and more. Margaret asked Charlotte calmly, with strangely serene eyes.

“Does he know you are the Duchess of Renosa?”

“No, he probably doesn’t. But he saw you today and knows the Grand Duchess of Rinosa is the owner of that name, so he might guess who I am. He seemed convinced that I’m related to you.”

Charlotte, realizing she had slipped up, looked embarrassed.

“It doesn’t seem like he would tell anyone else, but I should still ask him to keep it a secret.”

“Yes, do that.”

Margaret’s gaze moved hazily towards the window as if looking at a distant place.

A whisper-like sound flowed from her mouth.

“That boy might have seen my portrait. The portrait of the Irene Marquis’ daughter.”

Charlotte exclaimed in realization.

“Ah! That makes sense. It could have been a portrait he saw by chance. Then it’s natural he wouldn’t know you are the Grand Duchess of Renosa.”

After a few more words, Charlotte stood up.

“I’ll be going now.”

“I look forward to seeing you again at the palace.”

“Should I ask Helmut directly?”

“No, you don’t need to. I plan to meet him myself soon. If he is as talented as you say, he will win this tournament.”

“Right. Meeting the Grand Duchess of Renosa as the champion… It’s a fitting occasion.”

Charlotte bowed and left. A maid discreetly guided her out.



H.F.C Chapter 231 (Part 2):

`				`Now only Margaret remained in the room.

The elegant and serene face of the lady showed a change. The hidden agitation momentarily took over her expression.

Margaret blinked slowly with an indescribable expression. Her fingertips trembled.

Margaret vividly remembered the scene 15 years ago when she let go of her child. The pendant abandoned with the child.

A pendant given by a mother to her child had her maiden name engraved on it.

The flow of thoughts naturally continued in Margaret’s mind.

It was unbelievable, but…

She couldn’t dismiss the possibility.

The assumption that her first child, abandoned in the Forest of Roots, had returned alive!

If that were true…

Margaret closed her eyes tightly.

\*

That night, Helmut was facing Alea again.

She was currently the only person with whom he could share his joy or sorrow.

Though she seemed to anticipate everything, this time, Alea was genuinely surprised.

“So, the Grand Duchess of Renosa is your mother?”

“There’s no doubt.”

“Did your mother… recognize you?”

“I don’t know. She seemed agitated. But isn’t it hard to believe that the child abandoned in the Forest of Roots would return alive?”

“Yeah, you are the first. And to be honest, I don’t know how your mother would react to that fact. It’s a dangerous situation, isn’t it?”

Alea spoke cautiously, as if advising him to be careful. She knew the physiology of nobles well.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa had her first child taken away because he carried the Seed of Darkness.

But did she resist? As the Grand Duchess of Renosa, she would have accepted it due to duty, pressure, or whatever reason.

It probably hasn’t changed even now.

Instead of instilling caution towards his mother, Alea subtly inquired.

“Of course, the temple doesn’t know you carry the Seed of Darkness. But do you plan to reveal it to your mother?”

“…I don’t know.”

Helmut hesitated. But his expression soon turned resolute.

“I must win this tournament.”

Alea, about to point out the danger, paused.

She understood why Helmut was so determined.

Logically, it was right to discourage him. If it was true that the Grand Duchess of Renosa was agitated by Helmut, then he had already strongly made his existence known to her.

Wouldn’t she want to converse with the boy who resembled her deceased first child at least once? His goal could be achieved this way too.

“Or you could approach through Charlotte, the Duchess of Renosa.”

There were smoother ways to go about it.

But what brought Helmut this far wasn’t reason. It was desire and longing.

The longing to find his mother who had cried out for him before their separation drove Helmut.

Alea didn’t fail to understand what Helmut wanted to prove and show his mother.

There are times when one must take some risks for the sake of their life’s goal.

Whether this was a risk worth taking, even Alea didn’t know.

But it was Helmut’s decision to make.

He would undoubtedly attract attention in this swordsmanship tournament, and two high priests were heading to Renosa. Advising him to hide was the logical choice, wasn’t it?

But Alea didn’t stop him. Because she also wished for Helmut’s victory.

It was a trivial reason. Alea placed absolute value on being number one.

If she did something, she must be the best. Alea took that for granted.

“Yes, win.”

Alea answered with a bright smile.

\*

The next day, after winning the second round, Charlotte immediately sought out Helmut.

Until then, she hadn’t approached him to stay focused on the tournament.

Charlotte had never explicitly said that Margaret Irene was her mother, but she thought Helmut could guess.

But since Helmut wasn’t talkative, she didn’t think he would tell anyone that she was a Duchess.

“Um, senior. I have something to tell you.”

When Charlotte cautiously approached him in the training ground, Helmut immediately turned to her.

“What is it?”

“Did you… meet her yesterday at the swordsmanship tournament…”

“Are you talking about the Grand Duchess of Renosa?”

“Yes, did you happen to see her before?”

Charlotte was careful. She was indirectly asking if he knew Margaret Irene was the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

There was a difficult barrier of truth between them.

Though his sister, Charlotte wasn’t on his side. He couldn’t trust her easily.

After a brief contemplation, Helmut decided to feign ignorance.

“She was an elegant lady.”

But it meant he didn’t know. It was natural to be suspicious. Helmut had said he had seen Margaret Irene.

But if Charlotte asked where he saw the Grand Duchess of Renosa, he would be at a loss for an answer.

About knowing the name Margaret Irene.

Helmut had learned that Margaret was no longer called by that name.



H.F.C Chapter 232 (Part 1):

`				`Charlotte was confused.

‘Does he not know my mother? Then how does he know the name Margaret Irene? And why did he say I resembled her?’

Helmut didn’t seem like someone who would lie.

But something felt off. Before she could ask more, Helmut quickly ended the conversation.

“I want to focus on training now.”

Helmut had another match tomorrow. For those selected from Greta Academy, the match took priority.

Charlotte nodded and stepped back.

“Oh, okay.”

As she left, still mired in doubt, Charlotte realized something. Helmut was hiding something.

It was about her mother. Charlotte’s gaze grew serious.

‘Could it be something that would harm my mother or Renosa?’

If that were the case, she couldn’t leave it alone. But it didn’t seem likely.

Was knowing her maiden name really that significant?

‘The tournament comes first for now.’

They were in the semifinals. Charlotte was aware of how lucky she had been.

Her next opponent was tough. Robin from Matesis Academy, whom she had previously clashed with at the training ground.

Though Taren, a more skilled opponent, was eliminated, it was because he faced Helmut.

If not for that, Taren would have been a strong contender for the championship.

Robin wasn’t much weaker than Taren.

Which meant Robin was stronger than Charlotte, who was just a first-year.

Robin was a championship contender, second only to Helmut.

Charlotte watched Robin’s matches for analysis. And she realized Robin was stronger than her.

Until now, she had fought and won against opponents she thought were stronger than herself.

It was due to her effort, her luck, and the fact that her opponents underestimated her.

Charlotte’s skills were now proven by reaching the semifinals, and her opponents knew her abilities.

They knew her small stature and unique fighting style.

She wasn’t confident. But even without confidence, she wanted to reach the finals.

It would bring great honor to Greta Academy and herself.

She was the duchess of Renosa, and this was the capital, Ratona.

‘For now, I should think about how to win this match.’

Of course, winning the championship would be even better.

But Charlotte didn’t think she could defeat Helmut. Compared to him, her next opponent seemed more possible.

Charlotte set aside her doubts about Helmut. It was her mother’s matter to deal with.

\*

That night, Helmut’s crystal ball lit up.

It was a message from Talon.

“I’ve delivered the documents to the Mercenary Guild.”

With a brief message, Helmut nodded.

Now, he had one chance left. One chance to get information from Black Hawk. He had to use it very carefully.

Helmut went straight to the Mercenary Guild to retrieve the documents, moving stealthily to avoid detection.

Back in his room with the documents, Helmut quickly scanned through them.

He had ordered a thorough investigation of the current Renosa Grand Duchy.

“Members of the Renosa Grand Duchy.”

The list contained the names of everyone bearing the Renosa surname, whether directly or through branch families.

Though he skimmed through it, Helmut’s name was not there. He had likely been erased from the family records.

It wasn’t particularly bitter.

That was the fate of a child with the Seed of Darkness. To be erased immediately upon discovery at birth.

But fate failed to erase him.

Helmut had returned to the place of his birth, escaping the fate meant for a child with the Seed of Darkness.

Or was this also fate? Helmut wanted to decide the end of this fate with his own hands. That’s why he became stronger.

Lost in thought, Helmut flipped through the documents.

His eyes stopped on a familiar name. He hadn’t noticed it while looking for his own name, but it was there in the list.

“Michael.”

The name was listed as a direct descendant of the Renosa Grand Duchy, alongside Charlotte’s.

At the sight of the name, Helmut frowned.

‘He is…my brother.’

It flowed naturally, allowing comprehension – why he had been unusually generous towards Michael, despite him not being a descendant of Darien who owed Helmut a debt like Luke Yeager.

There had been a moment when Helmut felt reluctant to silence Michael if he caught on, unlike his usual ruthlessness.

Helmut knew well that he was a cold-hearted person.

Most people don’t consider killing or sparing a life so easily.

But beyond Michael’s kindness.

Michael had something that made him reluctant to act against him. Blood was indeed thick. They were twins.

‘Michael resembles our mother.’

Though he hadn’t been aware of it, it seemed that way. He knew Michael wasn’t a good or trustworthy person.

Telling him the truth would be hard. He hadn’t even decided whether to tell their mother.

Even without familial affection, it felt strange.



H.F.C Chapter 232 (Part 2):

`				`Helmut slowly read through the documents. They contained quite detailed information.

That Charlotte was studying at Greta Academy, that she didn’t get along with Michael.

Michael and Charlotte were in a competitive relationship, but Michael was the likely heir since Charlotte wasn’t ambitious.

And about the favoritism of the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

‘Favoritism… Is that why Charlotte is pushing herself so hard?’

Knowing they were family made Helmut more interested in Charlotte.

As if someone had given him permission.

Charlotte was extremely diligent. She spent the most time training with the sword in the dormitory.

Her efforts weren’t just about being earnest.

She seemed to want someone’s recognition. As if she wanted to be seen.

She was one of the most desperate participants in this swordsmanship tournament.

‘For our mother…’

Just as Helmut wanted to prove himself to her, Charlotte must feel the same.

He realized one more thing.

‘Was it Michael who took Charlotte away back then?’

Charlotte and Michael didn’t get along on the surface. Charlotte seemed troubled.

Michael’s reason for taking her was likely to show off his influence within Renosa.

That’s why he used the Black Wing Knights to bring her in as a guest.

Knowing that his two siblings, whom he didn’t even know existed, didn’t get along, made Helmut feel strange.

He never expected a warm, harmonious family waiting for him outside the Forest of Roots, but he hadn’t anticipated discord either.

‘If the two fight……’

He wouldn’t take sides, but Michael had tried to recruit him.

Having reached the semifinals in the swordsmanship tournament, he would soon draw attention. If he won, he would inevitably face Michael.

‘Michael didn’t show up at the tournament, either because he’s interested in the senior tournament or because he’s ill.’

That was an accurate analysis. Michael, who seemed to have recovered, fell ill again after the Grand Duchess of Renosa’s visit.

He was too ill to care about the swordsmanship tournament.

Though the Grand Duchess visited him daily, she didn’t cling to him as before, as if her mind was elsewhere.

Helmut thought about his two siblings. Two completely different people, Charlotte and Michael.

Just because they had the same hair color didn’t mean they were on the same side, but he felt Charlotte would be more favorable to his presence.

‘But Michael likely wouldn’t welcome the existence of a brother.’

Even if he held goodwill towards Hyde, learning that Hyde was Helmut would change things.

The reason was simple. Hyde was highly skilled. Michael wanted Hyde as a subordinate, not as a sibling.

Michael, who was wary of Charlotte, would find it hard to show the same goodwill upon learning the truth.

Michael was certainly a formidable opponent. Quick-witted and smart.

If he was close to their mother, revealing that he had returned alive from the Forest of Roots to her wouldn’t be wise.

Their mother wouldn’t speak out until she was sure.

A child with the Seed of Darkness was someone whose existence shouldn’t be known, someone to be buried.

Helmut decided to remain calm. His heart was passionate, but his reason was cold.

Alea, who he conversed with daily, always made his reason clear.

Even if a child who had died and come back was dear, he wouldn’t be dearer than the one who had always been by her side.

‘For now….. it’s best to observe the situation.’

Just hinting at his existence to their mother was enough. Helmut wasn’t yet strong enough to fight the temple.

Helmut made his decision, but whether he could follow it smoothly was uncertain.

\*

The next day, the Grand Duchess of Renosa came to the tournament venue again. She wanted to avoid showing that she was particularly watching someone, so she had to watch all the matches in the junior tournament.

As if she had taken an interest in the swordsmanship tournament. Today was Charlotte’s match.

The Grand Duchess even turned down Michael’s request.

‘Mother, won’t you stay by my side today? I’m not feeling well……’

It was the first time she could turn away from his pleading blue eyes with a feeling of guilt.

Margaret had a hard time refusing Michael’s requests because she was weak to him.

But now, something more important occupied her mind. Even though the boy wasn’t competing today, he might visit the venue.

And just like last time, there could be danger, and she was worried about Charlotte facing a tough match.

‘If she gets hurt… A match with real swords!’

Michael didn’t want her to be interested in Charlotte.

So he often used his illness to attract Margaret’s attention.

Margaret knew that too. She knew but couldn’t help it. She was the one who gave birth to the sickly Michael.

He was a pitiable child who was often ill enough to be close to death from a young age.

Relative to that, Charlotte’s health made her less worried.

She was grateful that Charlotte had grown up well even with less attention.



H.F.C Chapter 233 (Part 1):

`				`‘That child also made a lot of effort.’

Margret knew how impressive it was to become a selected participant in the swordsmanship competition within less than a year of entering the academy.

Charlotte had always been a diligent and steadfast child. A faint smile appeared on Margret’s lips.

There isn’t a finger that doesn’t hurt when bitten, but not all fingers hurt equally.

There were less painful fingers and more painful fingers.

For Margret, Michael was the more painful finger. But that didn’t make the less painful fingers meaningless.

At this moment, Margret’s gaze was on the less painful finger.

Her eyes turned towards the stage. Two selected participants were standing there. One was Charlotte, and the other one was…

“What are you worried about? Do you have the mind to think about other things?”

Robin asked sarcastically, looking at Charlotte, who had her gaze upward.

After Taren was brutally defeated by Helmut and eliminated, he alone bore the honor of the swordsmanship department of Matesis Academy.

He had watched the match between Helmut and Taren.

Helmut’s skills were real. His sword was so fast and harsh that it gave chills. Robin thought he wouldn’t have had a different outcome than Taren.

But this girl, Charlotte, was different.

Robin judged that Helmut was abnormal, but everyone else was at an ordinary level.

Even if they were excellent, they weren’t overwhelmingly so in this swordsmanship competition.

Among such excellence, it was natural for Robin, from Matesis Academy, to stand out the most.

‘A small frame, agile movements. She’s not an easy opponent. Moreover, she’s a pretty and seemingly weak girl, so anyone might hesitate and end up getting hurt.

Looking at how far she’s come, she must have some skills, but can I really lose to her?’

Anyone would let their guard down in front of Charlotte. Robin wasn’t completely relaxed, but he didn’t place Charlotte on the same level as himself.

He would surely teach her a lesson. Even if there was that one genius, the rest would show that Matesis was superior to Greta!

Robin smiled as if he were certain of victory.

“This is a glorious stage watched by the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Let’s have a great match together.”

Charlotte finally responded.

“Yes, indeed.”

Her gaze that had been toward the Grand Duchess returned to its original position. This was the stage watched by her mother. Her heart raced with excitement.

Somehow, she didn’t feel like she would lose. Renosa’s Ratona was Charlotte’s home stage.

Everything seemed to be on her side. Even the air and wind swirling around this place.

Charlotte gripped her sword handle. Her heart, filled with determination and confidence, was rather calm.

Early this morning, she had a sparring session with Helmut. He had proposed it himself.

Helmut was not the type to propose sparring with anyone. To him, sparring with someone was meaningless.

When she asked why he was helping her, Helmut replied,

“It’s also good for me if you reach the final stage.”

That didn’t mean he helped her because she was an easy opponent compared to Robin.

To Helmut, both Charlotte and Robin were similar opponents.

Helmut had simply lowered his skills to an appropriate level to spar with her.

Even so, it was still challenging for Charlotte to deal with him.

Charlotte told Helmut,

“I will achieve good results to make your help worthwhile.”

She intended to keep that promise. Charlotte’s eyes firmly fixed on her opponent.

Soon, the match began.

Waaaaaah!

Excited cheers hit the stage. The match continued for over 30 minutes. This meant there wasn’t much difference in their skills.

Robin seemed to have better endurance, but Charlotte’s endurance was not inferior.

The seemingly endless match saw a decisive moment when the impatient Robin made a move.

Robin’s sword grazed Charlotte’s shoulder. It was an unavoidable strike.

Red blood splattered onto the stage.

A woman stood up abruptly from the shaded area.

Her shoulder was burning, and her head soon felt dizzy.

Yet Charlotte kept her hawk-like sharp gaze locked on her sword.

Blood could be seen dripping from her opponent’s neck. It was where the tip of her sword had grazed.

The impact of her injury had nearly caused her to falter, but she succeeded in not fatally wounding him.

And she won. She won.



H.F.C Chapter 233 (Part 2):

`				`Charlotte’s gaze was intensely piercing at that moment.

Waaaaaaah! Cheers erupted again. Robin looked at Charlotte with a pale face.

His jaw clenched. However, regardless of what resistance he felt, he had to accept the result.

Charlotte had laid a trap, and Robin, who had patiently identified traps from the start, eventually lost his patience in the prolonged match.

He attacked Charlotte’s shoulder and, in return, exposed his neck.

“You should get treated immediately.”

The attendants who came up with worried faces led Charlotte away for simple first aid treatment.

Charlotte briefly glanced up at where her mother was, then followed them off the stage. She felt a sense of relief.

She had done it. In front of her mother. Even though she did not reveal that she was the Duchess of Renosa, in front of everyone.

Charlotte thus secured her spot in the finals of the academy’s comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Before Helmut. Helmut, watching from the audience, frowned.

‘So I’ll be facing Charlotte.’

The irony of facing his younger sister in front of their mother. But there was also a reason he had helped Charlotte.

He wanted Charlotte to reach the finals. His mother would want that too.

There was another calculation as well. When their mother sees the pair of a young boy and girl who resemble each other pointing swords at each other, what would she think of?

When she sees the boy who resembles Charlotte and is older than her, would she be reminded of her lost son?

Michael would probably appear there too. Although the attention would be more on the senior matches relatively, the finals were a different story.

‘Will Michael recognize me?’

Helmut thought it was highly likely.

If his instinctive pull towards blood relations was the reason he had been generous to Michael, then Michael may have felt the same towards Helmut as well.

Not just out of desire for a skilled swordsman, but something more.

If Michael sensed Hyde in Helmut, he would immediately connect Helmut to Hyde.

Michael wasn’t just smart; he had intuition.

However, even if Michael felt that pull towards blood relations, if he truly realized Helmut was a blood relation, he would not welcome that fact.

It was inevitable that Helmut would face Michael.

But Helmut had thought that not only his mother, but Michael too might get a strange feeling upon seeing Helmut’s resemblance to Charlotte.

Might Michael sense something unknown to him through that intuition?

As the most cherished child of his mother, would Michael know the truth that Charlotte didn’t?

If he knew about the stillborn older brother, and if he suspected and investigated his survival.

‘For now, I have to face them.’

Now only the semifinals and finals remained. It would only be after completing that final act on the brightly lit stage that Helmut would finally face his mother and Michael.

Helmut still had a safer option.

If he was eliminated in the semifinals, he would receive relatively less attention.

But he didn’t feel like doing that. He intended to reveal himself and confront directly. His resolve hadn’t changed.

Helmut stood up. The area around his mother, which had been noisy for a moment, was now calm.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa had left. It was plain as day where she had headed.

‘The dormitory must be festive.’

Since two representatives from Greta Academy would face each other in the finals, the Greta Academy faculty would be overjoyed.

Perhaps this would be the first and last gift Helmut would give them.

That’s how he felt.

“The bleeding has stopped, and the wound will heal soon. Take this medicine. It will help the flesh to grow back.”

Charlotte frowned as she swallowed the bitter medicine.

Due to the blood loss, she felt dizzy.

But Charlotte was in a good mood. She had come much farther than she initially expected. As if luck was on her side.

Things were going well. Her mother was watching her in this tournament.

She could even feel her mother’s worried gaze from afar.

Charlotte’s efforts were being rewarded.

As she caught her breath, she suddenly sensed the footsteps of several people approaching.

Soon, the door to the treatment room where Charlotte was opened. A noblewoman with dignified golden hair stood there, her face pale.

“Your Highness, the Grand Duchess! How could you come to such a place?”

The swordsmanship tournament attendants hurriedly bowed their heads.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa stepped into the waiting room with elegant but quick steps.

She had rushed over without a second thought, but regained her composure along the way. It was excessive for her to come looking for Charlotte. But it could be managed.

Margret spoke in a stern tone.

“Is the treatment finished? I was startled to see such a young girl injured and rushed over.”

If she were a kind-hearted noblewoman, she might rush over upon seeing an injured young girl participating in the swordsmanship tournament.

Though puzzled, everyone accepted it readily, thinking how kind she was.

“Her condition is stable. With treatment, she will recover soon.”

“I see. That’s a relief.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa, suppressing her emotions, looked towards Charlotte and commanded.

“I wish to speak with this child, so all of you leave us.”

“Yes, Your Highness, the Grand Duchess.”

With everyone leaving, only Margret and Charlotte remained.



H.F.C Chapter 234 (Part 1):

`				`“Oh, Charlotte. What happened to you?”

The Grand Duchess, pale and distressed, rushed over and caressed Charlotte’s cheek.

Charlotte greeted her with a smile.

“Mother, you’re here?”

Charlotte didn’t blame her mother for revealing her appearance without considering the risk of exposing her true identity.

She had already exchanged words with her mother several times before. No matter how careful she was, someone was bound to notice her eventually. But at this late stage of the tournament, it wasn’t a major issue.

It would be problematic if it became known at Greta Academy that Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Charlotte decided not to think about it any further. She was enjoying the happiest and most rewarding moment.

She had secured a spot in the finals, and her mother was completely focused on her. There was nothing more she could ask for.

Margret frowned, concern evident in her eyes.

“I don’t know if it’s right for you to wield a sword while bleeding like this. My heart nearly stopped when your shoulder got cut.”

“It’s a real sword tournament, so it couldn’t be helped. I knew I wouldn’t die, and I won.”

“Yes, well done. But I don’t want you to go through such danger again. I can hardly bear to watch. Shouldn’t you withdraw from the next match?”

They were facing the finals. If Charlotte withdrew now, the tournament would be ruined.

Margret was urging Charlotte to withdraw, disregarding the chaos it would cause to the tournament Michael had organized.

It was an unacceptable suggestion from the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

It was a mother’s plea. Margret had never spoken to Charlotte in such a manner before.

Charlotte had always thought her mother favored Michael over her, but now she realized that the reason might be different from what she had imagined.

‘Perhaps Mother is afraid of the possibility of losing her child.’

Seeing Margret’s reaction, that thought crossed Charlotte’s mind.

Looking back, Margret had always been especially attentive when Michael was ill.

It was just that Michael was often sick, which had directed Margret’s attention entirely towards him.

Margret was a noblewoman who faithfully fulfilled her role as the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

That duty took precedence over her affection for her children.

She worried about Michael’s health, but she never acted irrationally, like following him to Basor.

Charlotte had always been healthy, rarely falling ill like Michael.

Even when she did get sick, it was usually just a cold, and often when Charlotte was unwell, Michael was severely ill.

In this swordsmanship tournament, Charlotte had faced real swords and had to endure several serious injuries and near-death experiences.

Margret could not remain indifferent to that.

Charlotte calmly shook her head.

“It’s something a swordsman must endure. However… there won’t be such a thing in the next match. Helmut is far superior to me in skill. By a lot.”

There were opponents that neither luck nor perseverance could overcome.

Even if Helmut were to stagger onto the stage with a high fever, Charlotte would not be able to defeat him. That was the gap between them.

Thus, unless Helmut intended otherwise, Charlotte would not be in danger.

Helmut could win the championship without even causing Charlotte a scratch.

Probably with a single strike, as he had done so often before.

“You’re certain he will advance.”

“Yes, I won’t be able to defeat him. Not because of a lack of confidence, but because it’s a fact.”

Helmut was too strong. This kind of comprehensive swordsmanship tournament was almost trivial for him.

Margret nodded slowly.

“I’m relieved. I wanted you to win, but more than that, I prefer you to be safe.”

Margret held Charlotte’s hand and added cautiously.

“Take care of yourself.”

“Yes, mother.”

\*

The next day, Helmut confirmed his advancement to the finals, as expected.

It was almost effortless. He defeated his opponent with a single strike.

Under the watchful eyes of the Grand Duchess of Renosa, Helmut wrapped up his match more composedly than usual. Now, only the finals, two days away, remained.

That night, Alea asked Helmut.

“Is your plan still the same?”

“Yes.”

After the finals, Helmut would attract unprecedented attention here in Ratona.

As the champion of the swordsmanship tournament and a bearer of Greta Academy’s honor.

Helmut’s skills were overwhelming.

Those with eyes would notice him more than the senior winner.

Given his dominance among his peers, no one knew how much more he could grow in the future.

Helmut planned to stay in Ratona for a while, leveraging his title as champion.

The Grand Duchy of Rinosa would surely give him such treatment.

“I’m not sure if this is the right thing to do.”

Alea sighed. She too was having a premonition. A premonition that Helmut had caught some kind of flow. A feeling that things wouldn’t continue smoothly like this.

As if a major event was lying ahead.

However, Helmut was still in the fog. It was difficult to imagine any situation after the final match.



H.F.C Chapter 234 (Part 2):

`				`Helmut tilted his head.

“I’ve heard rumors that the High Priests haven’t arrived in Rinosa yet.”

“Then something might have happened on the way.”

There was a way to track their whereabouts through Talon. But that wasn’t a good method. It would raise suspicions in Talon.

Questions about why Helmut was curious about the High Priests’ whereabouts.

‘Where on earth did they go? Has there been anything recently that would draw the attention of the temple?’

Alea also wondered. She soon spoke as if she had made up her mind.

“I’ll head to Rinosa as soon as possible.”

Alea’s eyes deepened. She had to find out.

Heike, being an Archmage, might have a way to discover something.

The final exams were now over, and Alea was on vacation. It wouldn’t be long until they met again.

Alea added with a smile.

“Good luck in the finals.”

\*

Now the dormitory was empty.

Loen Academy, which hadn’t produced even a single finalist, had already left the dormitory in a dejected state.

Without leaving any greetings.

In this aspect, the academies of Baden didn’t show much unity.

Their competitive spirit was clearly evident. Because there was a sense of ranking each other, there were no gestures like shaking hands and saying, “Let’s have a fair competition.”

In contrast, Greta Academy’s achievements were remarkable.

In the senior tournament, Leon succeeded in advancing to the finals, while Nils failed.

Nils stayed at the dormitory to spar with Leon, who still had matches left, and left the dormitory yesterday.

It was vacation, so they couldn’t stay in Ratona indefinitely.

During vacation, they could finally enjoy freedom away from the academy. Everyone had their own lives.

Instructor Patricia joked,

“It’s good for the academy that the students are doing so well, but for us, it means we have to work through the vacation.”

“Well, it’s all for the best,” Professor Luxen responded with a laugh.

On the Matesis Academy side, they seemed to have something to boast about, having one finalist in the senior tournament.

All other students except for him left the dormitory immediately.

The faculty remained, but they seemed to be avoiding the Greta Academy faculty.

They too must have had to admit it. That the current Greta Academy’s sword department was superior to that of Matesis Academy.

Now the dormitory was quiet. It would become completely silent after the finals. Because everyone would leave this place.

Helmut thought about where he would stay after the finals. He could stay at an inn, but it would be too exposed.

This dormitory felt more private.

‘I hope Rinosa will provide separate accommodation or allow me to stay here.’

He intended to request it as a privilege of the winner.

If not, even through Charlotte.

Helmut looked forward to the final match with neither a heavy nor light heart.

\*

The day before the finals, Michael finally managed to get out of bed.

His physical condition was still not very good. He felt languid and tired.

It was frustrating to have a body that absolutely shouldn’t overexert itself, but he had gotten used to it.

‘This time was a bit long.’

Due to the fever that prevented his head from working properly, he couldn’t attend to his duties properly.

In fact, he hadn’t done anything for the past few days. If the Grand Duke knew this fact, he might reconsider Michael’s disqualification as his successor.

Michael knew that the Grand Duke was scoring his children.

Charlotte had an absolute advantage that Michael didn’t have. Swordsmanship and health.

‘At least, if I could just avoid falling ill like this.’

Michael frowned. It was something that Michael, who was used to handling all situations as he wished, couldn’t control.

The act of becoming healthy.

Still, it was definitely better than when he was younger and couldn’t leave his sickbed. It was thanks to the magic and expensive, good medicines that were poured into him.

Michael got up. It was time to assess the situation.

Well-organized reports were placed by his bedside, ready to be viewed at any time.

As he skimmed through the reports, Michael frowned.

As he had intended, his mother had consistently watched Charlotte’s matches.

It seems she was concerned about Charlotte, who was fighting in dangerous matches, while rejecting Michael who tried to keep his mother by his side with the excuse of being sick.

It would be troublesome if her heart leaned towards Charlotte.

But he wasn’t worried. Michael knew how to draw his mother’s heart to himself.

‘The finals, huh.’

Time had passed without him properly seeing the tournament he had prepared.

Michael’s eyes fixed on the names of the finalists in the junior comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Charlotte and Helmut.

‘Helmut…’

A name that strangely caught his attention. He didn’t know why. Tilting his head, Michael calmly decided.

‘I should attend.’

Everything would become clear when he saw with his own eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 235 (Part 1):

`				`‘Helmut… Where have I heard that name before?’

In the carriage heading towards the tournament venue, Michael furrowed his brow.

He had a remarkable memory. He could recall even the fleeting moments that had brushed past him.

But nothing specific came to mind. It wasn’t a commoner’s name. It was a name that would be more fitting for a noble, even in Renosa.

Michael tapped his forehead as he tried to recall information about the person named Helmut instead of the name itself.

‘Extremely skilled. Black hair, black eyes. A handsome face that gives off a cold impression, as if he inherited the blood of Renosa.’

Michael, with his blonde hair and blue eyes, did not like his own appearance. It seemed to highlight his weakness.

Michael had always made good use of his delicate and gentle appearance.

An angelic appearance with a kind demeanor, but with a frail and pitiful side.

One of the strongest emotions that govern people is compassion.

Although no one dared to pity him, most people genuinely felt sympathy towards Michael.

That sympathy cloaked Michael in an aura of purity and goodness.

Even if his intentions were impure, he was rarely suspected.

That was Michael’s greatest weapon. Naturally, eliciting trust and affection from others, interpreting his intentions in a favorable light.

However, that very appearance, which made it easy for him to get what he wanted, didn’t quite suit someone aiming to become the Grand Duke of Renosa.

Charlotte had that appearance. An appearance that perfectly resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa.

But so what? Michael possessed something she did not.

Michael bit his fingertip.

A belated sense of anxiety welled up. While he had been bedridden, unaware of the unfolding situation, his mother’s attention had shifted to Charlotte, and Charlotte had advanced to the finals.

It was an incredible feat for a first-year student in the swordsmanship department.

It was as if she was declaring to Michael that she had achieved something he could never attain, no matter how hard he struggled.

‘How annoying.’

Michael, with a childish expression, recalled Helmut.

‘A commoner, wasn’t he? And they said he resembled Charlotte.’

Perhaps he could become a variable. If he truly is a branch family member of Rinosa.

If his exceptional swordsmanship caught the eye of the Grand Duke of Renosa, how would the Grand Duke accept this new Renosa bloodline?

It might be an overactive imagination. But it nagged at him.

‘Something doesn’t feel right.’

No matter what Michael thought, the carriage arrived safely at the tournament venue.

Michael glanced at the other carriages that had already arrived. His mother must have been notified.

A seemingly kind smile spread across Michael’s face.

“Mother.”

Soon, upon arriving at the seats prepared for the people of the grand ducal family, Michael bowed to the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

She, already seated at the head seat, opened her eyes wide.

“Michael, welcome. Are you feeling better?”

“I’ve recovered enough to come here. Since I’m hosting the tournament, I should see it through to the end.”

“I’m worried you might have overexerted yourself coming here.”

“Above all, it’s Charlotte’s match. It’s worth it.”

“Charlotte has seen blood several times on stage. In my heart, I wish she wouldn’t compete any further.”

Michael had wished the same. He hadn’t expected Charlotte to climb this high.

Had he known in advance, he might have tried to obstruct her.

The achievements she displayed would shine brightly when it was revealed she was the Duchess of Renosa.

And Michael didn’t want Charlotte to be in the spotlight. He replied with a smile.

“Since she’s reached the finals, you should watch with peace of mind. I’m worried about Charlotte too.”

Michael glanced at the stage. He had arrived at just the right time.

The two finalists were being led to the stage. Michael murmured.

“It’s about to start.”

Charlotte had a stiff expression. Was it the pressure of the final stage?

She was just one step away from winning. Though that one step was nearly impossible to take.

After all, it had been no easy feat for Charlotte to reach this point.

In that respect, Michael felt reassured by the appearance of the genius Helmut.

‘At least because of him, Charlotte won’t be able to win.’

Helmut, a second-year student at Greta Academy. He had swiftly defeated all his opponents, to the extent that it affected the tournament’s popularity, but Michael couldn’t help but feel a strange mix of irritation and fondness towards him.

Michael liked strong individuals. They were always useful as his chess pieces.

‘Regardless of the match outcome, I must meet him.’

There might be other ulterior motives, but if he’s of common birth, it would be difficult for him to refuse the wealth and honor Michael could offer.

Michael had a talent for making others desperately want what he could give.

Margret’s gaze momentarily wavered as she looked at the stage.

But she soon spoke in an elegant yet calm voice.

“Charlotte said she wouldn’t be able to win. Her opponent must be exceptionally strong. Being from the same academy, she would know better.”

“Did you meet her separately?”

Michael’s voice became slightly sharp.

Margret didn’t notice.

“Yes, I know it was rash. But I couldn’t help it after seeing her hurt. Fortunately, no rumors have spread. I’ve taken care of it.”

“That’s a relief. But that’s not like you, Mother. If it becomes known that Charlotte is the Grand Duke’s daughter of Rinosa, she’ll be exposed to even more danger.”

Perhaps Michael himself might have to create that danger if the situation calls for it.

If Margret continued to pay more attention to Charlotte, and if the Grand Duke of Renosa’s gaze started turning towards the accomplished Charlotte.

Michael’s eyes gleamed coldly. But Margret didn’t notice.

“I know.”

She seemed lost in thought, unable to continue speaking.

Michael’s gaze shifted from Charlotte to the boy on stage.



H.F.C Chapter 235 (Part 2):

`				`The distance from the high seat to the stage wasn’t close. But the boy’s presence was exceptional.

‘Is that Helmut?’

Michael examined him carefully.

Helmut was a boy who gave off a tense, threatening vibe. His jet-black hair and eyes enhanced that feeling.

His face was perfectly expressionless, and his relaxed posture made him seem as if he were out for a stroll.

In stark contrast to the tense Charlotte. As if he knew he would win.

Everyone who had shown such an attitude had been defeated by Charlotte in this tournament.

But Helmut exuded an air of detachment. It seemed as if the tournament was nothing to him.

‘He looks familiar somehow.’

Michael squinted. Nothing in his memory was triggered, but his face was familiar.

Michael could think of only one person he resembled.

‘The Grand Duke of Renosa. Father…’

He had heard they looked alike, but this was astonishing. Enough to truly suspect the Grand Duke’s infidelity.

Michael’s gaze captured both Helmut and Charlotte.

The pair of a boy and girl in one view looked remarkably alike.

As if they were molded into male and female versions of one being.

As if they, not Michael, were siblings.

And it wasn’t just Michael who felt this way.

“They look… just like siblings.”

Margret muttered involuntarily, then flinched in surprise.

Michael’s lips curled upwards.

“Indeed, they do look like siblings. As if he, not I, were Charlotte’s brother.”

As if he were Charlotte’s half-brother.

The hall buzzed with murmurs. Everyone was suspecting their blood relation.

Even those who knew Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

The one who resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa the most, shining brightly as the representative of Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department, appeared in Ratona. Could this be a coincidence?

Hearts were drawn to that uncertainty.

Michael disliked the potential meaning of his opponent.

But now was still the time to watch.

“This should be interesting.”

Michael’s blue eyes gleamed coldly.

\*

Helmut exhaled lightly. The noise surrounding him seemed to have no effect on him.

Despite his relaxed appearance, Helmut hadn’t slept a wink the previous night.

He was the type to sleep when necessary. He could fall asleep anywhere if he wanted.

But last night, that need didn’t work. His heart was strangely pounding. Beating heavily.

That throbbing lessened as he ascended the final stage.

His mind, previously overwhelmed by the beating, became clear.

This was the final stage. And his younger sister Charlotte was standing before him. In a completely tense state.

For her, she probably wanted to avoid losing miserably in front of her mother.

She wouldn’t want to be defeated in one strike like the previous opponents.

But regardless of her will, it was nearly impossible for Charlotte not to lose in one strike.

That is, unless Helmut deliberately went easy on her.

A new dilemma arose for Helmut.

‘Should I go easy on her?’

No one would want the final stage to end anticlimactically.

But if the stubborn Charlotte realizes this, wouldn’t she feel humiliated?

Helmut had to decide which was better. There wasn’t much time left to decide.

Charlotte greeted him stiffly.

“It’s an honor to face you, Senior.”

“I’ll end this without hurting you.”

Because it was in front of their mother. Not that he ever intended to hurt his sister.

Charlotte’s face wavered at Helmut’s condescending remark.

She placed her hand on the sword’s hilt, tightly pressing her lips together.

“I hope you won’t get hurt either, Senior.”

Her voice, spoken with determination, seemed to surprise even herself, but she didn’t let her expression waver. An unusually defiant look for her.

A fleeting smile appeared on Helmut’s lips.

Just like his sister.

Soon, the signal rang out.



H.F.C Chapter 236 (Part 1):

`				`Instinct?

The trajectory of the sword was swift like a beam of light. Charlotte clearly saw the sword flying towards her.

Her heightened concentration, which seemed to let her even feel the flow of air, made it possible. It was an odd occurrence.

Charlotte herself never thought she could read Helmut’s sword movements, even while preparing for this competition.

It was a realistic assessment.

But, unrealistically, she avoided Helmut’s first strike.

It was an unblockable sword. Helmut raised his eyebrows as he watched her perfectly react and evade the sword’s range.

“This tournament has helped you grow.”

Helmut muttered as if surprised. He didn’t particularly go easy on her. He knew that would be humiliating for Charlotte.

He believed no one except Asuka could evade even his single strike.

He didn’t overestimate his sister. While sparring with Charlotte, he never once thought she could achieve such a feat.

‘She knows how to create variables.’

That was Charlotte’s strength.

However, he couldn’t allow any more variables.

Helmut lowered his body and dug in. From Charlotte’s perspective, it must have felt like a beast was descending upon her.

Clang! The swords clashed. Charlotte gritted her teeth. She lost sensation in both hands due to the impact.

The enormous pressure felt like it was going to crush her wrists. That was the power of Vis.

Charlotte summoned Vis to resist. But it was like trying to block a waterfall with a stream. The Vis was rapidly being drained.

Rather than shaping Vis, it was purely a manifestation of physical strength.

However, when a stronger opponent clashed with such force, there was no other way to resist.

Helmut was overwhelming Charlotte with sheer force. If she relaxed even for a moment, her sword would slip from her grasp.

Although she wouldn’t get hurt as Helmut had declared, defeat would immediately follow.

The moment this balance of power broke, she needed to create an instant gap to counterattack. It was Charlotte’s only option.

But the balance mustn’t crumble completely. Otherwise, she would collapse instantly.

There was a subtle moment. A moment where she wasn’t sure if she could do it. But Charlotte was adept at seizing opportunities.

Her sword, completely drained of power, pointed downwards, and Helmut’s sword swiftly and fiercely dug in.

It aimed at her neck and pointed at it.

But Charlotte perfectly read Helmut’s intent.

At that moment, she shifted the balance and twisted her arm.

She explosively released the Vis that had been consumed merely to receive the blow, targeting the center of his body.

Just as Helmut aimed at her neck, her chest would be exposed. This sudden flexibility was her forte.

At that moment, the corner of Helmut’s mouth lifted slightly.

It seemed like a flash had just grazed by.

Clang, clang, clang!

The sword slipped from her grip and rolled on the ground.

Charlotte fell to the floor from the shock that seemed to paralyze her body.

Thud! Her knees ached as they struck the ground.

‘How…?’

Only questions lingered in her mind. Charlotte didn’t see how Helmut moved this time.

She merely followed her calculations, failed, and lost.

Waaaaaaah!

Fierce cheers hit the stage. It might have ended quickly for a final, but another factor was exciting the audience.

The appearance of the absolute strong, Helmut! Even on the final stage, he proved himself.

‘Is this the difference in skill?’

Charlotte looked at her empty hands.

She didn’t feel bitterness or regret. She had done her best, but her opponent was simply too strong.

Helmut calmly looked at her. He sheathed his sword, not a speck of dust on him.

Before and after the match, Helmut felt no change.

It was certainly a much easier competition compared to the Basor tournament.

‘I wonder if learning the Empire’s common swordsmanship was useful..’

He didn’t even have a proper chance to fully display his swordsmanship. He simply swung his sword.

That was enough.

Since leaving the Forest of Roots, the one thing he longed for was meeting an opponent he could fight with all his might.

Opponents like Darien or Elaga.

In the Forest of Roots, Helmut experienced frequent and numerous defeats.

Helmut suddenly pondered.

‘Can I still not defeat Elaga?’

If Elaga had devoured Naho, he would have become stronger, so probably not.

Elaga was not only a magical beast with immense magical power but also knew how to fight.

Elaga probably wouldn’t fear the temple even after leaving the Forest of Roots.

A somewhat unpleasant conclusion that he still had a long way to go.

Now Charlotte had something to say.

After gathering her thoughts, Charlotte spoke calmly after a moment.

“Senior, congratulations on your victory.”

Helmut extended his hand towards her.

“You did well too.”

Charlotte took Helmut’s hand and stood up, dusting off her hips.

She was in better condition than any other match before the finals.

The shock Helmut gave was temporary. Since she didn’t sustain any internal injuries, she would probably recover in a day or so.

Charlotte didn’t forget that she avoided Helmut’s first strike.

And that was something she hadn’t foreseen. She narrowed her eyes.

“Did you perhaps go easy on me?”

“If you call making sure you didn’t get hurt going easy, then yes. I’d win anyway, and you’re my junior after all.”

Helmut spoke as if it wasn’t for her sake.

But knowing it was a rare consideration from him, Charlotte suddenly harbored suspicion.

That suspicion immediately turned into words.

“Senior, you don’t happen to like me, do you?”

If he had been drinking water, he might have spat it out.



H.F.C Chapter 236 (Part 2):

`				`Helmut, unusually flustered, stared at Charlotte. Charlotte frowned.

“You helped with the sparring and all… Something feels off.”

‘He has been doing things he doesn’t usually do, could it be?’

It could be possible. Helmut and Charlotte didn’t have much contact within the academy.

However, since coming to Renosa for this swordsmanship tournament, their conversations had increased significantly.

No matter how indifferent Helmut was, it was natural to develop feelings for a girl you frequently talked to and spent time with.

Helmut slightly shook his head as if to wave it off.

A pointed remark that you’re not originally that kind-hearted.

That was true, but Helmut, who didn’t actually like Charlotte, slowly denied it.

“…No.”

“I know you’re indifferent. But coming to this swordsmanship tournament with me, you might have developed affection and grown fond of me, right?”

It seemed she was questioning whether he was unaware of his feelings.

Although it could be considered presumptuous, Charlotte was extremely serious.

She was seriously asking if he liked her.

Helmut couldn’t find the words to say and remained silent for a moment before speaking.

“I have a girlfriend.”

“Really?”

“Yes, the girl I was with during the festival.”

“I’ve heard about that. Then I believe you.”

Helmut stared at Charlotte intently. Charlotte, having come to a clear conclusion, smiled brightly.

“That’s a relief. I won’t have to feel uncomfortable around you.”

This was her doctrine that such matters should be made clear.

Charlotte wanted to get along with Helmut, and she didn’t want to give false hope to him if he liked her.

Helmut might find it unpleasant, but Charlotte was the Duchess of Rinosa.

She had never even dreamed of a union with a commoner. For a high noble, there are suitable partners befitting a high noble.

Usually someone the family would at least not oppose.

And Helmut was clearly not that kind of person.

Just as Margret was faithfully the Duchess of Renosa, Charlotte had a similar inclination.

“You, why do you suspect such things so naturally?”

Helmut was a bit taken aback. He wasn’t feeling bad or unpleasant, but he had never seen anyone so confidently suspecting he liked them.

Helmut didn’t understand girls around this age well, but he thought it wasn’t a common occurrence.

“Well.”

Charlotte swallowed her words as if embarrassed.

She had received double-digit confessions since entering Greta Academy.

With her noble impression, easygoing and steady personality, she was liked by everyone, not just the instructors.

Even Asuka couldn’t treat Charlotte rudely.

Young men from good families who were confident showed interest in her.

Leon, who was brutally defeated by Helmut, was one of them.

But each time, Charlotte firmly declined, saying she wanted to focus on her studies.

Her refusals were consistent and straightforward, so they didn’t cause any resentment.

So it was natural for Charlotte to suspect that someone who was particularly kind to her might like her.

“The awards ceremony will start soon. I heard the prize money is substantial. There will probably be more special privileges.”

“Special privileges?”

Charlotte stared at him intently. And after a moment, she said.

“The privilege of meeting the people of the Grand Duchy of Rinosa.”

The Grand Duchy family of Rinosa is comparable to the imperial family of the Empire. They are people that only the noblest of nobles can meet.

However, Helmut now had the right to approach them.

Helmut didn’t ask how she knew that.

Charlotte is the Duchess of Rinosa. Helmut knew this fact, and Charlotte vaguely sensed that Helmut knew it.

Charlotte gave him advice.

“You might meet some difficult people. Be careful not to clash with them.”

Helmut silently nodded. He seemed to understand what she was saying.

‘Michael.’

He would meet him soon. Michael’s observational skills were exceptionally good.

People reveal their characteristics in many aspects.

Posture, attitude, atmosphere. Beyond appearance, all of that proves their identity.

Moreover, Helmut wasn’t very talented at acting.

Hyde was just Helmut with a changed appearance, and thus, Hyde was Helmut.

Whether Michael could discern this would only be known when they meet.



H.F.C Chapter 237 (Part 1):

`				`“Helmut, I knew you could do it!”

“Well done, Helmut!”

“Charlotte, great job too.”

“I’m proud of you both. You are the pride of Greta Academy!”

As soon as they stepped off the stage, words of congratulations poured in.

The faculty members of Greta Academy, who had stayed until the end, rushed over.

They’ll be free to go once Leon’s results come out tomorrow.

Before that, the Swordsmanship Department had achieved an almost perfect outcome. Only Nils, who was eliminated early, might not be so pleased.

Instructor Alan asked.

“So, Helmut. How do you feel?”

“How I feel… Well…”

Helmut was incredibly calm.

Even if he had won the final match of Basor’s martial arts tournament on the spot, his reaction would have been the same.

“What a boring guy. The award ceremony is about to start.”

Instructor Patricia patted his shoulder as she walked past. Amidst the surrounding commotion, Helmut thought calmly.

‘So it has come to this.’

He had won. Now everything was about to begin. Charlotte’s face was bright with happiness.

She seemed to have relaxed after the tournament ended.

They were in Ratona, Renosa, her hometown.

Although the semester had ended, Charlotte was already in Renosa, so she could start her vacation without any time loss.

From today, Charlotte would return to her place as the Duchess of Renosa.

When the vacation ends, she’ll return to Greta Academy as the top first-year student in the Swordsmanship Department.

Soon, an attendant came running and shouted.

“The award ceremony will now proceed. The two of you, please come up to the stage!”

Amidst the applause from the faculty, Helmut stepped forward with Charlotte.

Winner Helmut, and runner-up Charlotte.

The awards will be presented on stage. And the one presenting might be…

A tension like before a battle rose up.

It was a strange, gut-wrenching feeling, not just the usual pre-fight nerves.

If it were merely the tension from an upcoming battle, he would be used to it. The heaviness of his steps felt unfamiliar to Helmut.

Charlotte’s face, following behind him, also seemed to stiffen.

One figure was already on stage. Behind him were knights dressed in black.

They were members of the Black Wing Knights. Helmut’s gaze turned to the figure on the stage.

Someone spoke to Helmut.

“It’s the Duke of Renosa.”

The sunlight was blinding.

There stood a small boy with blonde hair, dressed in white ceremonial clothes.

With an angelic face and features as pretty as a girl’s, the boy wore a gentle smile. Yet, Helmut knew how cold his personality was.

Although the boy had only shown kindness to Helmut.

He had hardly changed. Having shared a room with him, Michael’s appearance was familiar even after all this time.

‘No, maybe he was never unfamiliar from the start.’

Helmut wasn’t pleased with the situation where his brother might become an enemy.

Michael’s eyes narrowed. He strode up and stood before Helmut. His eyes curved softly.

“Haven’t we met somewhere before?”

“I’m not sure.”

The indifferent response stuck in Michael’s ear. His eyes showed a spark of interest.

He stared at Helmut intensely, as if he could see through to the flesh beneath his skin.

“But why do you seem so familiar to me?”

Helmut didn’t answer. Michael took another step closer. The look in his eyes was familiar.

Cold and indifferent. Though the color was different, the essence of the gaze was clear.

Magic had changed Helmut’s appearance, but not his skeletal structure.

If you made slight changes to Helmut’s face, you’d get a person Michael could perfectly recall.

However, this confused Michael.

Because the Hyde Michael knew was neither a commoner nor someone he thought would have Renosa blood.

And he didn’t expect him to appear this way.

Changing the impression of an ally he had held oddly favorable feelings for wasn’t easy for anyone. Not even for Michael.

But Michael soon steadied himself and smiled coolly. His low whisper reached Helmut.

“This is unexpected. I was looking for you, and here you are right in front of me.”

Without another word, he turned away from Helmut.

As if there was no need to confirm anything further. As if he was certain Helmut was Hyde. It was a confidence in his own judgment.

Michael glided over to stand before Charlotte.

Charlotte gazed at Michael with a tense face.

If he were to announce here that she was the Duchess of Renosa…

But Michael didn’t act according to her fears.

“Congratulations on your second place, Charlotte.”

Michael’s voice was polite. It was different from the soft way he used to call her Charlotte.

He seemed determined to keep his promise.

Charlotte nodded.

“Thank you.”

Without saying anything more, Michael stepped back with a strangely cold demeanor.

His gaze took in both Charlotte and Helmut. The two had met at Greta Academy.

Could this really be a coincidence? Might Charlotte know something?

The feeling that something unknown was happening troubled Michael, furrowing his brow.

It was a feeling unpleasant to someone who wanted to grasp everything within his control.

“The Grand Duchess of Renosa will now present the awards to the winner and the runner-up!”

An attendant loudly announced once more.

Originally, it would have been Michael presenting the awards, but the Grand Duchess of Renosa was present.

So it wasn’t strange for her to conduct the ceremony.

Before the match ended, she had already asked for Michael’s consent.

Because she had to confirm up close.



H.F.C Chapter 237 (Part 2):

`				`An elegant blonde lady ascended the stage. Maidservants and knights followed her closely.

As Margret came up on stage, cheers erupted from the audience.

She was gentle and dignified, truly befitting the wife of a leader ruling a country.

Margret took the medal and approached Helmut.

Very close, close enough for only him to hear her whisper.

The reflection of light from her hand came from a winner’s medal bearing both the symbol of the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament and Rinosa’s Black Wing.

But Helmut felt no emotion toward it.

Yet, the moment was overwhelming.

Her gaze was calm as she looked at him.

Helmut felt it. His memories were being drawn up, existing right before his eyes.

The sensation was like a dead life resurrecting and taking flight.

This is what it feels like when something you’ve risked your life pursuing comes to fruition.

For the first time, Helmut realized it.

She could hang the medal on the winner and offer words of encouragement.

Margret opened her mouth.

“Helmut.”

Her voice was soft and low. It hadn’t changed much from the voice in Helmut’s memory.

Helmut pieced together the fragments of his memory. Margret’s presence made it possible.

“Yes.”

“Your name doesn’t feel unfamiliar to me.”

Margret slowly hung the medal around his neck. It was an elegant movement without a hint of agitation.

Not a single fingertip touched him.

But her gaze wavered.

As if torn between wanting to speak and knowing she shouldn’t.

“You remind me of someone I know.”

“Who is that?”

Helmut asked. He too was torn between wanting to speak and knowing he shouldn’t.

He wanted to pull out the pendant from his chest right then and ask if she knew what it was.

To ask if she knew who he was.

He wanted to tell her that he had lived, grown up, and returned from the Forest of Pahe.

It was a desire he felt for the first time since meeting Darien in the Forest of Roots.

But all those words burned hotly in his throat like a fireball.

Margret tilted her head and answered quietly.

“Someone who’s already been forgotten. I buried that person too. But…”

Margret frowned.

“Strangely enough, seeing you reminds me of that person. As if the dead have come back to life from the grave.”

If anyone else listened, they might suspect a past lover of the Grand Duchess of Rinosa. But Helmut’s striking resemblance to the Grand Duke dispelled such suspicions.

Margret spoke again.

“You’re the top second-year student at Greta Academy, right?”

“Yes, I’m close with Charlotte.”

Helmut spoke as if he knew Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Margret smiled with wistful eyes.

“Are you staying in Ratona?”

“I’d like to for a while.”

The conversation felt almost coordinated. As if a secret pact was made.

“Then it would be good to change your lodgings. As a special privilege for the winner, I’ll arrange for you to stay at the palace. You can have meals with Charlotte since you’re her senior.”

“That would be an honor.”

Helmut spoke formally, masking his rising emotions.

Margret whispered kindly.

“I saw your excellent skills. Thank you also for not hurting Charlotte. As the Grand Duchess, I promise to treat Helmut as an honored guest, as the winner of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.”

“Thank you.”

Having said what she wanted, Margret turned away from him. Applause erupted.

Helmut watched intently as she placed a medal around Charlotte’s neck.

Unlike Michael, who was certain Helmut was Hyde, Margret wasn’t sure if Helmut was her child.

But that intuition would drive her.

He caught snippets of conversation.

“Charlotte, you were amazing. I’m so proud of you. To come this far as just a first-year student.”

“Now I can return to the palace, right?.”

“Yes, let’s go back and rest. Greet your companions first.”

“Ah, what did you and Helmut talk about?”

“He said he’d stay in Ratona, so I offered him a place in the palace. I will treat him as an honored guest.”

“Oh, I see.”

Charlotte glanced skeptically at Helmut.

There was still an unresolved question.

How did Helmut know the name Margret Irene?

But even Charlotte didn’t know if that was an important issue.

Today, at the end of the tournament, was a day to celebrate.

‘If senior is staying in the palace, I’ll ask him slowly.’

Charlotte turned her gaze away from him.



H.F.C Chapter 238 (Part 1):

`				`The next day, the senior swordsmanship tournament finals took place.

It was a match involving Leon, the fourth-year representative from Greta Academy.

After a grueling hour-long battle, Leon, drenched in sweat, managed to secure the victory.

With this, Greta Academy had produced two champions and one runner-up.

Only Nils, who had been eliminated early, felt a bit bitter.

However, his bitterness wasn’t as great as that of the other students from Baden academies.

Especially the arrogant students from Matesis Academy, who couldn’t even lift their heads due to the unexpected result from Greta Academy, which they had looked down upon.

The only piece of good news for all Baden academies was the outstanding performance of their students, who had been excluded by the temple.

All the top-ranking participants were from Baden.

The instructors were in a celebratory mood.

“Congratulations to all of you!”

“We’re proud of you.”

Even the usually stern Instructor Patricia and the strict Instructor Alan were beaming today.

Had Ethan Kudrow been present, his reaction wouldn’t have been different.

Leon, despite winning the highly esteemed senior swordsmanship tournament, remained humble.

Somehow, he kept his distance and sat far away from Helmut.

As everyone from Greta Academy acknowledged, Helmut was superior to Leon. Leon, even with his newfound confidence, hadn’t forgotten this fact.

For the remaining members of Greta Academy, the staff at the lodging prepared a lavish banquet.

Although the tournament had ended, they didn’t need to leave the lodging immediately, but they would have to vacate it soon.

Everyone would return to their respective places.

The academy instructors didn’t comment much on Helmut’s decision.

The Ratona Palace was too grand a place for a commoner like Helmut, but he was the tournament champion.

As long as it wasn’t a threat to the student’s safety, the faculty had no say in where he stayed during the vacation.

However, they were curious about Helmut’s decision.

“I heard you decided to stay in Rinosa. Does Instructor Ethan know about this?”

“I plan to write him a letter.”

“Do you like it here?”

“Yes.”

His short answer left them guessing. Instructor Alan nodded.

“Well, if the Duchess of Renosa has promised good treatment, staying here during the vacation isn’t a bad idea. Ratona’s scenery is beautiful.”

“Though, I wonder if you can avoid being recruited by the Black Wing Knights.”

“The Black Wing Knights would surely covet someone like Helmut.”

Charlotte, sitting next to him, glanced around slightly. Helmut casually cut her off.

“We’ll see.”

Becoming a member of the Black Wing Knights to stay close to his mother was something he had considered.

Being a guest as the tournament champion was temporary.

For Helmut to stay in Renosa long-term, he needed a valid reason. A reason to leave Greta Academy and remain here.

But was there meaning in staying around like that?

His mother wasn’t in danger, and there was no need for Helmut to protect her.

If his mother didn’t need him, should he still stay here?

Wouldn’t his presence be more of a burden?

Helmut calmed down. He had found his mother and confirmed she was living safely and peacefully.

And he had revealed his existence to her.

Perhaps that was enough. His purpose might have been fulfilled with that.

If any further wishes would cause harm, he should stop. Helmut accepted this fact calmly.

“With the semester over, you’ll soon be a third-year student.”

Professor Luxen muttered, stroking his chin. The instructors exchanged smiles.

They continued their conversation as if nothing had happened.

Helmut silently lifted the glass of water in front of him.

He was facing a turning point.

However, returning to the academy didn’t seem to be an option at this juncture.

Changes were bound to occur.



H.F.C Chapter 238 (Part 2):

`				`The very next day, the Greta Academy group dispersed.

The swordsmanship tournament had ended, and with the vacation upon them, everyone went their separate ways.

Only the faculty had left. The three remaining students had no intention of leaving Renosa immediately.

Helmut stayed at the lodging, and surprisingly, so did Leon.

Charlotte staying was simply a given.

That afternoon, a carriage arrived from the palace along with some people.

As promised by the Duchess of Renosa, Helmut was to move to a new residence.

But unexpectedly, Leon accompanied him.

“We’re here to escort you to the palace. All three of you.”

Leon followed along willingly, as if he had received some kind of assurance.

Helmut realized belatedly that Leon was also a tournament champion.

In other words, a talent that the Black Wing Knights would covet. If they were giving Helmut a place to stay, it would be natural to do the same for Leon.

In fact, as a senior and soon-to-be graduate, Leon would likely receive even more generous treatment. To maintain appearances.

Margret, the Duchess of Renosa, managed it perfectly.

She maintained a perfect distance and carried out the procedures.

As he had felt when they met before, if Helmut hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed that his mother had been moved upon seeing him.

She was very composed.

In a way, she neither showed special affection nor animosity towards Helmut, who might be suspected as the Duke of Renosa’s illegitimate child, and treated Helmut and Leon with the same fair treatment as the tournament champions they were.

Upon stepping out of the carriage, Charlotte, guided by someone, slipped away quietly. Helmut and Leon bowed their heads in unison upon meeting the Duchess of Renosa.

“We are honored to meet you, Your Grace the Duchess.”

“Welcome to our Renosa palace.”

The elegant and graceful Duchess smiled kindly. A smile that made the young boys feel insignificant.

Even the usually arrogant Leon couldn’t bring himself to look up at her.

“Please enjoy your stay. Since it’s vacation, rest as much as you like and leave at your convenience. Latona’s scenery is beautiful, so feel free to go out and enjoy it. As champions, you deserve to enjoy this.”

“It’s an honor, Your Grace.”

Leon was the first to respond promptly. He was from a noble background. Helmut thought Leon was useful in this situation.

Helmut didn’t know what to say. He just replied briefly.

“Yes.”

Her gaze lingered on Helmut for a fleeting moment. Eyes as blue as a lake, filled with an indecipherable emotion.

However, Margret, who had looked at Helmut briefly, immediately turned her attention to Leon.

“I’ve heard that my son Michael is very interested in you. He said you had a conversation right after the award ceremony.”

“Yes, His Highness showed great interest in my swordsmanship.”

“Michael must have been deeply impressed by your skills. I hope you can get along well, even if it’s a bit inconvenient.”

“Inconvenient? Not at all, Your Grace!”

Leon immediately lifted his head. He already seemed half-enchanted by Michael.

Michael had a knack for winning people over. Especially someone like Leon, who had lived somewhat isolated due to Helmut’s overshadowing presence.

Michael was not only impressed by Leon’s skills but also intended to gather information about Helmut through him.

Because even if Michael was certain in his heart, he was the type of person who needed evidence for his certainty.

That’s what Helmut thought. He wasn’t particularly skilled at understanding people, but he could read Michael’s intentions clearly.

It wasn’t knowledge-based understanding; it was perhaps an understanding born from blood.

“Michael is indeed a brilliant and intelligent person, fitting for the heir of Renosa. If he had joined the academy, we would have formed a deep friendship.”

“Oh, I’m glad you think so highly of Michael.”

Margret responded with a soft laugh. Leon passionately praised Michael, the future lord.

He already acted as if he had become a member of the Black Wing Knights.

In that short moment, he seemed to have decided his path completely. Watching them, Helmut calmly collected his thoughts.

‘The Black Wing Knights are indeed desirable for top students from the academy.’

Even without ulterior motives, Leon’s skills alone would make Michael want to recruit him.

Although he had lost to Helmut in a single strike, Leon was still a recognized talent outside.

Michael had a strong desire for talent.

It was strange that he hadn’t tried to recruit Helmut, the champion, yet.

Or perhaps it wasn’t strange. Michael was convinced that Helmut was Hyde.

‘Michael… I will have to face him eventually.’

Since the award ceremony a few days ago, Michael hadn’t approached Helmut personally.

Normally, Michael would have gathered enough information about Helmut with just a few conversations, but he decided to hold back for now.

Helmut didn’t think Michael had lost interest in him. Michael was persistent.

He wouldn’t just rely on Leon to gather information about Helmut.

And Helmut’s guess was precisely correct.

\*

Returning to her room and changing her clothes, Charlotte stretched her back.

She felt comfortable, as if she had found her place.

No matter how high her status, Charlotte had lived her entire life as the Duchess of Renosa.

She was more familiar with being the Duchess of Renosa than Charlotte from Greta Academy.

Now, she wasn’t even the runner-up Charlotte; she was the Duchess of Renosa during the vacation.

She didn’t intend to hide it from Leon either.

Just as she was about to leave the room, someone’s voice came down upon her.

“Charlotte, what do you know about that person called Helmut?”



H.F.C Chapter 239 (Part 1):

`				`It seemed he had been waiting. Charlotte silently turned to look at Michael, who was staring at her with his arms crossed.

His face wore a smile different from usual. A cold smile closer to his true nature.

“Charlotte.”

His tone was coaxing. Soft yet subtly coercive.

“You’re close to him.”

Charlotte frowned. Helmut was an outstanding swordsman.

It would be more strange if Michael, who loves talented individuals, didn’t covet him.

However, Michael’s words seemed to imply something beyond that.

‘Michael must also be suspecting that Senior Helmut might be of our family’s bloodline.’

If Helmut were the Grand Duke’s illegitimate child, he could potentially threaten even Michael’s position.

Michael would never tolerate such a situation.

But Charlotte didn’t clumsily defend Helmut. She had no intention of telling Michael what she knew.

“We became close while coming to Rinosa, but I’m not that close to Senior. As you know, we can’t reveal our identities at the Academy.

Senior only recently found out that I’m from Rinosa. I don’t know what you’re curious about, but I don’t know much about Senior Helmut. I probably don’t know more than you do.”

Charlotte guessed that Michael must have done some background research. There probably wasn’t much information available about Helmut.

Michael didn’t take his eyes off Charlotte for even a moment. His gaze was observant.

“You’ve known him since the first semester. Do you know what your Senior Helmut did during the vacation? Where he went, for instance?”

“No, we never talked about such things. I told you. I’m not that close to Senior Helmut.”

Charlotte firmly denied it. Her words were true. But Michael didn’t stop.

“Then when you saw him after the vacation, was there anything different about him?”

“Well, something different…”

Charlotte, about to answer without much thought, suddenly flinched.

Helmut had changed after the vacation. It was such a noticeable change that many people talked about it.

Charlotte wasn’t sure if she should mention it. There was something that felt off.

‘During the vacation, Senior Helmut’s skin had tanned, which became a topic of conversation. There were rumors that he might have gone to train in a hot region.’

Helmut is a famous figure in the Swordsmanship Department. Even trivial rumors about him reached Charlotte’s ears. Her thoughts naturally connected.

‘A hot region, Michael went to Basore. Then perhaps…’

Could they have met? Charlotte didn’t voice this suspicion.

But Michael sensed a slight agitation from her expression. He spoke in his characteristic gentle tone.

“Charlotte, answer me.”

Charlotte, lowering her gaze, blurted out.

“…I don’t remember anything.”

“You, you’re hiding something from me.”

Michael smiled. It was a smile that felt chilling. As if directed at his enemy.

To Michael, Charlotte was a being that easily crossed the line between family and enemy.

Especially when Charlotte tried to hide something from him, he became more hostile.

“If you can’t say it, I’ll tell you what I know. During the vacation when you came to Rinosa, I went to watch the martial arts tournament in Basore. And there, I met someone with extraordinary skills.”

Charlotte’s gaze returned to Michael.

One way to draw words out of someone is to speak your own. By doing so, he could elicit a reaction from the other person. That reaction sometimes becomes the answer.

Michael continued speaking smoothly with a bitten smile.

“His name was Hyde, age sixteen. That’s what he claimed. I didn’t think it was the truth. I wanted him. I wanted him so badly.

To the extent that I’ve never wanted someone so much in my life. Because he was truly strong. I knew it.”

“So what are you saying about this Hyde person?”

Charlotte asked, feeling a vague sense of unease.

“His skills were truly remarkable. Enough to defeat countless strong opponents and Palma Knights to reach the finals.

Although the final match couldn’t be held due to some incident, I consider him the winner. The Basore martial arts tournament is incomparable to this mere Academy swordsmanship tournament. The skill level of the participants is incomparably different.

If Hyde were an Academy student and had participated in this swordsmanship tournament, he would undoubtedly have won.”

Michael smiled and said clearly.

“I think Helmut is that Hyde guy. Even though his appearance, swordsmanship, and the sword he holds don’t match.”

Charlotte’s eyes widened.

“As you know, my eyesight is quite good.”

“Isn’t that just groundless suspicion? No matter how skilled Senior Helmut is, it’s hard to believe that a mere Academy student won the Basore martial arts tournament.”

“You’ve seen it too. Your senior’s skills.”

Charlotte couldn’t deny that. Inwardly, she thought that if it were Senior Helmut, it might be possible.

In Charlotte’s eyes, Helmut had no reason to attend the academy. Even the instructors didn’t try to teach him anything.

But then why was Helmut at Greta Academy? It was a puzzling question.



H.F.C Chapter 239 (Part 2):

`				`To the confused Charlotte, Michael asked casually.

“Did your senior always use that sword? The one he’s using now, I mean.”

Suddenly, a memory flashed through Charlotte’s mind.

Helmut’s sword had changed abruptly. Helmut had told Charlotte that he had to repair it, so he got a new one.

But for a sword that needed repairing, it was a gleaming masterpiece.

She hadn’t thought much of it at the time, but it did feel strange now.

“Well, I rarely had the chance to see Senior’s sword since we practiced with wooden swords. I don’t know about originally, but when we sparred with real swords, Senior used that sword.”

Charlotte intentionally omitted the truth that he had used the current sword when sparring with her after coming to Ratona, and evaded the question.

She had no particular reason to protect Helmut and hide the truth from Michael.

However, even without a reason, Charlotte instinctively did so.

Even though she herself harbored suspicions about Helmut regarding the name ‘Margret Irene’.

It was unlike the Grand Duchess of Rinosa.

“His sword looked new. The handle and scabbard all seemed to have been made recently. As if he had recently purchased a sword to avoid being recognized.”

That also struck a chord. But Charlotte responded with silence.

Michael calmly dropped a shocking statement.

“Hyde had the sword of Darien, the missing Sword Saint of Basore.”

Charlotte reflexively questioned.

“What?”

“Judging by his exceptional swordsmanship, Hyde was likely Darien’s disciple. But if so, why did Hyde quietly leave Basore? Without revealing his identity.

He could have held wealth and power in Basore. Instead of continuing meaningless studies at the Academy.”

Michael’s smile deepened.

“This is what I think. He had a purpose for coming to Basore, and he left after achieving that purpose. What could that purpose have been?

One thing is certain. After he appeared in Basore, the Palma Knights’ commander died.

There’s an official statement about his death, but everything is suspicious. And in Basore, the Sword Saint’s grandson appeared. What does this sequence of events mean? Doesn’t it seem to point to something?”

Michael pointed out sharply.

“The former Palma Knights’ commander, Lutus Cicero, betrayed the Sword Saint, and his disciple appeared to take revenge for him. That’s why he didn’t reveal his identity.”

“That seems like too much speculation.”

“Even if it’s a conjecture with weak evidence, it’s not just speculation. As you know, I rarely get things wrong.”

“Even so…”

Charlotte wavered. She could feel her own agitation showing on her face.

“I’d like you to be curious too. As a member of the Grand Duke’s family. Why that suspiciously skilled senior went to Basore, and why he decided to stay in our Rinosa.”

“Isn’t Senior Helmut staying in Rinosa because of Mother’s recommendation?”

By now, Charlotte was agreeing with Michael’s assertion that Hyde was Helmut.

She too, inwardly thought that Michael wasn’t wrong.

It was natural. Helmut’s skills were truly astonishing.

If it were him, it wouldn’t be strange for him to win the Basore martial arts tournament, and it wouldn’t be strange if he were the Sword Saint’s disciple.

In fact, Helmut had changed his sword. He’s a senior with many suspicious and secretive aspects. The suspicions Michael raised were fascinating.

However, Charlotte’s inclination towards Michael’s words was not merely due to his eloquence.

Michael calmly continued.

“He is someone who moves according to his purpose. His staying in Renosa isn’t just for such a reason. Doesn’t he look like he has Renosa’s bloodline to you?”

As if some kind of conspiracy was lurking.

“Stop it.”

In confusion, Charlotte ended the conversation. She saw the maids approaching from the other side. It wasn’t something to talk about in front of others.

Charlotte spoke as clearly as Michael had.

“You’re free to suspect whatever you want, but I’d prefer if you didn’t drag me into it. Michael.”

“Alright, if that’s your wish.”

Michael wrapped it up neatly. However, his eyes were still scanning Charlotte’s face observantly.

The heirs of Rinosa, Michael and Charlotte, moved side by side. It naturally became so as their paths were the same.

A picture-perfect banquet was welcoming the guests. The Grand Duchess of Rinosa, Helmut, and Leon were already present.

Charlotte and Michael entered the banquet hall as if nothing had happened.

The banquet where the Grand Duchess of Rinosa and her two children entertained the guests continued in a harmonious atmosphere. While hiding secrets.

A storm was approaching. As if dark clouds were rolling in.

No one could know what would remain when the sky cleared.



H.F.C Chapter 240 (Part 1): Storm

`				`It was deep in the forest. It moved as if flying over the mountain range. Agile yet silent movements.

Like a wild beast, but not running on four legs. Bipedal.

It was running while holding a blood-stained sword in one hand.

If someone saw it, they would think of one word:

Monster.

Tattered clothes, a body stained black, eyes horribly bloodshot, cracked skin, swollen muscles.

Once, its demonic energy soared as if it would reach the sky, but now it hung down like wet clothes.

Yet, the murderous intent in its eyes was palpable.

An aggressive instinct to kill, devour, and destroy. This being, full of wickedness, was once a human.

Yes, until just recently.

Before a certain change found him, he wasn’t even an ordinary person.

He wasn’t just any weak and feeble human.

A first-rank Platinum mercenary.

That was a prestigious position not attainable by just anyone.

Becoming a Platinum mercenary wasn’t a matter of effort. It was talent. Talent for Vis. Talent for the sword.

In terms of talent, he was exceptional. He had never seen anyone more talented with a sword than himself in his entire life.

From a very young age, he was different from others.

Although born a commoner, he was incredibly intelligent, quickly learning to read and amass knowledge with minimal guidance, and his physical movements were extraordinary.

He quickly realized that wielding a sword was more advantageous for him than studying.

For a commoner, martial prowess was the simplest means to elevate oneself.

But he was inherently violent and cruel.

Whether something within him made him that way, or if it was his natural temperament, he couldn’t tell.

But his violence and cruelty were beyond the control of reason, and he knew it.

That he was like an untamed beast.

At fifteen, when he ruled as the alley boss, he had a fight with a friend.

That fight stimulated something from within his heart.

Warm or gentle emotions didn’t touch him. Friendship had no effect on him. He had the dullest, coldest heart.

His cruel instinct, like that of a beast, didn’t stop at tearing apart the limbs of insects.

The hand that killed animals soon turned towards humans in anger.

After committing the act, looking down at the mutilated corpse and his blood-stained hands, he realized he could no longer live in this peaceful village.

His parents had long feared him, and so did the villagers.

Having committed murder, he knew he would be immediately identified as the culprit.

What if they did? He could just kill them all. It was an evil, tempting impulse.

But the thought he had immediately didn’t come to fruition in reality.

He was cruel, but not cruel enough to slaughter an entire village.

He was still human then. Reason and faint affection held him back.

But now he was a murderer. Leaving the village and changing his identity, he decided to become a mercenary.

Though an untrained swordsman, his talent alone was enough to make him a mercenary.

Other’s swords seemed laughably slow, and Vis quickly became part of him.

It wasn’t that he didn’t make an effort, and he enjoyed real combat.

As a mercenary, he learned swordsmanship by watching knights and other mercenaries, improving his skills.

It went smoothly. Knowing his own nature, he mainly took on jobs dealing with magical beasts rather than humans, and escort missions rather than guard duty.

At twenty-six, he reached the position of first-rank Platinum mercenary at a young age.

Since becoming a mercenary, he had encountered minor conflicts but lived a smooth life, proud that he had lived without any major problems.

Until that incident happened.

He was on a mission to hunt beasts, a type of mission he enjoyed.

During this time, he met the priests of Lumen for the first time in his life.

Were the priests the problem? Something about them stirred him deep within his heart.

It was a strange sensation. Although the priests were not hostile, there was an aura of threat from them.

As if they would annihilate his existence. Irrationally, it shook the vessel within him.

It was a vessel that had been slowly filling drop by drop since birth.

He was aware of the vessel within him that was about to burst.

He knew that when the last drop fell, the filled vessel would completely change him.

Knowing that all his talent, strength, and everything came from something lurking within him.

Though he didn’t know its name, he knew its existence.

Like he had made a pact with the demon lord said to have perished in ancient times, he knew that one day he would have to pay the price for having what ordinary humans did not.



H.F.C Chapter 240 (Part 2): Storm

`				`The Lumen priests were simply what triggered that final drop.

He didn’t know what they did. It could have been a trivial stimulus.

Just like when he killed his friend in childhood.

Reason flew away, and only pitch-black murderous intent engulfed him.

The explosion was intense. Someone might have shouted the term “Seed of Darkness.”

Reason disappeared, leaving only a monster driven by instinct. He killed three priests and five holy knights, leaving the scorched place behind.

Just as he had left the village where he lived with his parents, he didn’t have the reason to find a new home.

Reason is something that exists in humans.

He only had instinct left. The instinct to destroy everything!

He would follow that evil instinct. That was the price for having transcendent power.

It was also the end of a human dominated by the fully grown Seed of Darkness.

\*\*

Helmut’s life was peaceful. It felt like living in an expanded version of the Kudrow mansion.

Comfortable and luxurious living. If he hadn’t been born with the Seed of Darkness, these were things he should have naturally enjoyed in Ratona from childhood.

He had lived almost all his life in the forest, nearly as a commoner, yet strangely, the luxury suited Helmut well.

Helmut didn’t think it was because noble blood ran through his veins.

‘It’s probably because I adapt well.’

He knew that he was under scrutiny.

Helmut resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa. He heard the maids gossiping and he too was curious.

How much did he resemble the Grand Duke of Renosa? Would he feel a connection if he saw him?

‘Father, huh…’

At the moment of Helmut’s birth, the Grand Duke of Renosa was not present. The existence of a father was faint to him. He had never seen him even once.

Before Helmut knew that his mother was the Grand Duchess of Renosa, he even considered the possibility that she might have been a single mother or a widow.

But now he thought he understood why the Grand Duke didn’t appear at his birth.

His father was a Grand Duke, and thus too busy to even look back at the birth of his child.

Above all, the Grand Duke of Rinosa tended to be cold towards his family.

The only person he showed some affection for was the beautiful and virtuous Duchess, but even she did not take precedence over ruling Renosa.

‘Will I get to see my father before the vacation ends?’

He had a premonition that he might not return to the academy, but that premonition might be wrong.

With Ethan Kudrow and Alea at Greta Academy, Helmut always had a place to return to.

The Grand Duke of Renosa had left Ratona. That was the only news Helmut knew.

Even if he returned, there was no guarantee he would meet Helmut.

Helmut would stay in Renosa until the end of the vacation.

After that, there was no reason for him to stay.

Charlotte, the only person he knew, would leave for Baden.

Renosa would also send him away, telling him to return with her.

He couldn’t stay here indefinitely, treated as a distinguished guest.

So, something had to be settled before then.

‘But how?’

He couldn’t just abruptly show his mother the pendant.

Michael was wary of Helmut, only seeking Leon but sensing he was being watched.

From Helmut’s perspective, there was no way to personally approach the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

She had to come to him.

‘Will Mother really…’

Helmut decided to stay quiet until the attention on him waned, and until the maids got used to and stopped gossiping about the handsome boy who looked exactly like the Grand Duke.

That wasn’t difficult.

Helmut was treated as a distinguished guest. A spacious and luxurious room, a personal training ground, occasionally invited to banquets.

The past four days he spent in the Ratona Palace were very comfortable. Charlotte, who revealed that she was the Duchess of Renosa, didn’t seek him, often showing a complicated expression.

As if avoiding him.

Though Helmut was indifferent, he sensed something between her and Michael.

But it wasn’t Helmut’s concern. Alea had said she wouldn’t be in contact for a while as she had things to do.

Right now, the most important thing for Helmut was his mother.

‘Should I walk around the palace a bit?’

As the Grand Duchess of Renosa, it wouldn’t be easy for her to find an excuse to approach Helmut.

But she had told him, in a meaningful voice, that he could freely explore the palace.

Wasn’t that asking him to create an opportunity?

Helmut started moving. Guided by a maid, he soon reached a certain corridor.

A hallway lined with portraits of the Grand Duke’s family members.

Shortly after he stood there, light footsteps echoed through the corridor.

It was a presence he could recognize even with his eyes closed now.

Helmut waited until the owner of those footsteps got completely close.

An elegant and gentle voice reached his ears.

“Helmut, you were here.”

Helmut quietly turned to the side.

And he bowed his head towards the beautiful noblewoman standing there.

“Your Grace, the Grand Duchess.”



H.F.C Chapter 241 (Part 1):

`				`“How is life in the palace?”

“It’s…comfortable.”

The Grand Duchess was alone. Judging by the presence she sensed nearby, it seemed she had sent the attendants away.

It was a sign that she wanted to have a conversation.

She smiled faintly.

“I’m glad to see you’re adjusting well. I heard you were a commoner.”

It wasn’t a sarcastic comment about how well a commoner was adapting.

Even Michael didn’t speak to Helmut in that manner.

“I have lived in a noble’s mansion before. I had a noble guardian. Thanks to that patronage, I was able to enter the academy.”

“I heard you transferred to Greta Academy. How do you know this noble guardian?”

“He is an acquaintance of my master.”

Michael hadn’t told the Grand Duchess about his suspicion that Sword Saint Darien might be Helmut’s master.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa never rushed to interrogate. She led the conversation naturally.

Helmut knew that her caution was part of her nature.

She was someone who would never allow her foundation to be shaken.

She had been raised as a noble and lived as one.

The Grand Duchess spoke softly.

“How did you live before coming to the academy?”

“I lived in the forest. Just my master and I. Hunting and learning swordsmanship.”

The Grand Duchess’s gaze, which had been wandering, suddenly focused on Helmut. She asked slowly.

“What about your parents?”

“I was abandoned as a child and became an orphan.”

“I see…”

The two of them had, at some point, started walking side by side.

If there hadn’t been an age difference, it would not have been permissible for the Grand Duchess and Helmut to be alone together like this.

“Do you have any idea where you were born, or who your parents are?”

“I have a guess. But I think they must have had a reason to abandon me.”

“Have you… thought about finding them?”

“I don’t know if that’s what they would want.”

There’s a term called “force majeure.” Being born a commoner or a noble is more absolute than that.

Like Helmut, who was born with the Seed of Darkness and was abandoned because of it.

By leaving the Forest of Roots, Helmut made the impossible possible—he survived in a place where a person with the Seed of Darkness shouldn’t have.

But that was possible by his own will. Returning to his rightful place was another matter.

“I see. Don’t you miss them?”

“I do.”

Helmut replied briefly. Wasn’t it that longing that brought him here?

The Grand Duchess of Renosa closed her mouth. Their steps moved along the wall.

Portraits were lined up on the wall, as if narrating the history of the Grand Duchy of Renosa.

The power of the bloodline was strong. The resemblance was striking in the faces.

Then, Helmut suddenly noticed something and stopped.

“This place.”

There was an empty spot among the portraits. A place where a portrait should have been next to the current Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, beside a youthful portrait of Michael and Charlotte.

Helmut frowned.

“Why is this place empty?”

The Grand Duchess paused for a moment before answering.

“It’s a trace of someone we lost before we could paint their portrait.”

Helmut realized that it was his place.

It seemed like there were no traces of him left in Ratona.

It was as if the fact that a child named Helmut was born had been erased. If he didn’t have the pendant and his mother wasn’t here, Helmut might never have known this was his birthplace.

He was just someone buried in someone’s memory.

The Grand Duchess’s face trembled slightly as she looked at the empty space. She confessed, as if painfully forcing the words out.

“It was my first child, whom I had to let go due to an unfortunate accident.”

Helmut swallowed his words. He didn’t know what to say.

“I sometimes think about that child. It doesn’t hurt as much now that so much time has passed. If that child had grown up normally, how would he have turned out? Following the Renosa bloodline, he would have held a sword and probably become an excellent swordsman. He would have grown up splendidly as the heir to Renosa.”

The Grand Duchess continued with a subdued gaze.

“I was surprised when I saw you, Helmut. You resembled the child I had imagined growing up.”

A sharp pain pierced his heart. Or perhaps it was joy—he couldn’t tell.

Helmut looked at the Grand Duchess. She was also looking at him.

Her eyes held sadness.

And something else. Hope.



H.F.C Chapter 241 (Part 2):

`				`“Just as I didn’t send my child away by my own will, your parents probably didn’t send you away by their own will either.”

Commoners are different from nobles.

Unlike her, there are many parents who abandon their children out of necessity, whether it’s due to poverty or to protect their own lives, or because the child wasn’t supposed to be born.

But the Grand Duchess dismissed those possibilities. She spoke as if saying what she wanted to believe.

“That’s why I believe that if Helmut, who has grown up so wonderfully, were to return, they wouldn’t reject him.”

As if she would accept her first child if he returned.

Her words moved Helmut.

The wall that had been blocking him crumbled. Helmut spoke immediately.

“I’ve been told that I resemble the Grand Duke a lot. The same with the Grand Duchess.”

It was something that could be taken as disrespectful. How could a commoner dare to compare himself to the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Renosa?

But the Grand Duchess didn’t rebuke his rudeness. She nodded instead.

The peculiar atmosphere between them made it possible.

“Yes, Helmut looks like he belongs to the Renosa bloodline. Even to my eyes.”

“I… was born in Renosa. Probably here in Ratona.”

Helmut stared directly at the Grand Duchess. It was almost as if he were confessing to being the illegitimate child of the Grand Duke.

But the Grand Duchess realized that wasn’t what he meant.

Her blue eyes trembled. She asked quietly.

“Are your parents still here in Ratona?”

Helmut nodded calmly.

“Yes.”

“If you have any evidence or mark… I might be able to help you find them.”

For the first time, her voice wavered.

“I do have a mark. Something I had with me when I was abandoned.”

“What is it?”

But before Helmut could answer, someone’s voice interrupted their conversation from a distance.

“There you are, Mother.”

Both of them were startled.

Absorbed in their conversation, not even Helmut had noticed his approach.

It felt as if their secret meeting had been interrupted.

“Michael!”

“I heard you were heading this way.”

The blond boy with an angelic smile first directed his gaze to the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

As if deliberately ignoring Helmut’s presence.

He probably hadn’t heard their conversation.

There was a distance, and if he had come any closer, Helmut would have noticed him first.

“So, you were talking with Charlotte’s senior.”

“Yes, we were talking about Charlotte.”

The Grand Duchess smiled gently. It was a lie. Helmut realized she didn’t want Michael to know the content of their conversation.

Helmut felt the same.

“The Rinosa Grand Duchy’s portraits…”

Michael’s gaze lingered briefly on the empty space the Grand Duchess had been staring at. He wasn’t unaware of its existence.

“Oh my, it’s already this late. I have things to do. I must be going now.”

Seeing there was no further opportunity for conversation, the Grand Duchess expressed her intention to leave first.

“Feel free to look around. Michael, I’ll see you later.”

She calmly bid farewell to Helmut with a gaze and left.

Michael, the intruder, and Helmut were left alone.

Michael, who had been consciously ignoring Helmut, suddenly spoke.

“Helmut, are you doing well?”

“Yes.”

His short answer made Michael’s smile deepen.

“You’re not falling perhaps for my mother, are you? She’s still young and beautiful, after all.”

“It’s not like that.”

Helmut was especially careful when talking to Michael. He feared he might slip into casual speech, as he had done when dealing with him as Hyde.

“Then why do you seem to show emotions in front of her?”

“You must be mistaken.”

Helmut firmly denied it. He had become quite accustomed to lying now.

Michael laughed out loud unconsciously. But his expression soon turned cold.

“In that case, you should be careful. With the Grand Duke away, you could cause unnecessary misunderstandings.”

“It was Her Grace the Grand Duchess who sought me out.”

Helmut succinctly pointed out the fact.

After all, he had met many nobles at Greta Academy and hadn’t bowed to any of them.

It was the same outside the academy.

Especially if his opponent was his brother Michael, it was even less likely to happen.

No matter how much Michael was the Grand Duke’s heir and wary of him.

“That tone, it’s really arrogant. It’s very much like you. I liked that about you, but.”

Michael’s expression became strange.

He liked it. But not anymore.

It seemed like a denial should follow. But strangely, he couldn’t utter those words.

While his mind had defined Helmut as an enemy, his heart strangely couldn’t treat Helmut as one.

That discrepancy was peculiar.

It was a phenomenon Michael had never experienced before.



H.F.C Chapter 242 (Part 1):

`				`‘Are you really my brother?’

From the moment they first met, Michael was drawn to Hyde.

It wasn’t because he felt Hyde was strong, but rather, there was an inexplicable urge to keep him close.

It was a similar obsession to what he felt towards Charlotte.

Michael knew his desires well. No one was more faithful to his desires than himself.

Had it not been for the desire to achieve something despite being tormented by illness and close to death, he wouldn’t have survived such relentless suffering.

Michael realized that he still wanted to keep Hyde, or rather, Helmut, under his control.

It was a desire that was hard to ignore.

Whether it was due to a blood connection or not didn’t matter. It made him think differently.

‘Yes, after all, a bastard or a collateral branch can’t threaten my position.’

Even if the Grand Duke of Renosa favored Helmut, he was not the type to betray his wife and disrupt the bloodline.

Regardless of skills or talents, only the legitimate children could become the heirs of Renosa.

That was a principle that had been upheld for generations, and the Grand Duke of Renosa was not one to make choices that went against that principle.

‘Whatever his plans are, I’ll make it go my way. Taming a wild horse is never easy.’

Michael had faithfully played his role as the heir.

Even though he couldn’t wield a sword, even the discerning Grand Duke couldn’t deny that he was the most suitable to become the Grand Duke of Renosa.

Despite feeling a sense of unease in this portrait-lined room, Michael brushed off the feeling.

“Are you done talking?”

Helmut replied indifferently. Michael was a peculiar presence to Helmut as well.

He felt the urge to knock him down for being so arrogant but didn’t want to kill him.

Helmut was the type who found it hard to tolerate weaklings rising up, being accustomed to the law of the jungle.

And the Michael before him was pathetically weak.

Whether he had escorts or not, he could kill him with a flick of his finger. No one could stop him.

But strangely, he didn’t want to. Even though Michael was a nuisance, he found himself responding to him bit by bit.

Maybe it was because he was used to dealing with people like Asuka and Sian.

‘My patience has indeed grown.’

Just as Darien had said, academy life had made Helmut more human.

It seemed Darien’s arrangements were right.

Even though Darien himself was a grumpy and violent old man, he had a keen eye.

Michael smiled brightly.

“I hope we can see each other often from now on.”

And he added,

“It will happen.”

Leaving behind that arrogant declaration, Michael left.

Helmut looked indifferently at the empty spot where the portrait had been and then moved.

\*

Margret frowned.

‘Michael showing up.’

The moment she heard Michael’s voice, Margret was startled.

Michael was an overly perceptive child. He might have noticed something he shouldn’t have.

Margret was worried about that. It was a truth she hadn’t even revealed to the tight-lipped Charlotte.

Margret was a noble and the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Even though she loved her children, she couldn’t trust them fully and reveal everything.

Finishing the conversation with a calm smile, Margret returned to her room and fell into thought.

Her heart was beating rapidly.

‘He has the mark.’

A memory flashed through her mind.

Charlotte had told Margret that Helmut knew the name ‘Margret Irene.’

Suddenly, she remembered the pendant with her maiden name engraved on it.

Margret had placed it around her first child’s neck as a final gift when sending him away.

Hoping for blessings on his journey.

But that child had been sent to the Forest of Roots, and the pendant made for him had gone to a place from which it would never return.

That was the predetermined conclusion.

‘No, that’s impossible. Such a thing has never happened in history. It’s impossible.’

Margret murmured to herself. But doubt and suspicion filled her as she denied it.

What if there was a mistake? What if the temple misidentified him? What if their sacred magic was flawed and sent him elsewhere?

What if he had survived by sheer luck?

Helmut possessed exceptional talent.

A child born with the seed of darkness, although displaying great talent in childhood, would develop a cruel nature.

And ultimately, they go out of control and become monsters.

But Helmut seemed sane. Rather, he appeared very composed and calm.

He hadn’t harmed his sister in the slightest.

He didn’t show any murderous intent towards other competitors but decided his matches calmly.

Helmut didn’t trample others to showcase his strength.

Pacing around the room, Margret lifted her head. Her blue eyes gleamed with determination.

‘I need to meet him again.’

The more she met him, the clearer it became, and the more she wavered.

Despite thinking it was impossible, and wondering if the suspicious boy was playing tricks, no thought overrode her instinctive pull.

As Margret, not the Grand Duchess of Renosa, she decided not to hesitate any longer.



H.F.C Chapter 242 (Part 2):

`				`It was late at night. Helmut was swinging his sword.

He never neglected his training, knowing that everything depended on his own strength.

The thought of becoming stronger hadn’t diminished even after coming to the land of his birth.

As long as the temple existed, he had to be a sharpened sword, but even if the temple didn’t exist, Helmut would live as he always had.

To become stronger. He was a swordsman, and the sword was his life. Letting go of it would never happen.

Recently, Helmut had been training with a real sword instead of a wooden one.

He had become comfortable handling the sword he bought in Ratona.

Though it wasn’t as good as Darien’s sword, he liked it quite a bit. This disguise too.

‘I wonder if Michael has noticed something.’

It bothers him that Michael suddenly changed his attitude.

Although Michael seemed to say he would bother him, it wasn’t something that would happen immediately.

The personal training ground was quiet. It was connected only by a staircase and room, with no other entrances.

The door leading outside was locked. Renosa favored swordsmen.

That’s why they specially prepared quarters with these private training grounds for swordsmen.

‘Should I head in now?’

He felt uneasy. Even though he tried to focus consciously, it seemed there wouldn’t be much progress.

Recently, even Alea had declared silence, leaving him with little to do.

However, just as he was about to move, he sensed a presence outside the door.

It was a small footstep. But Helmut paused.

Although he had only heard those footsteps a few times, they were familiar to his ears. They sounded as loud as thunder.

Helmut’s gaze was drawn to it as if captured.

Creak. The lock opened, and the door moved. The hem of a long skirt entered first.

The blonde hair shining in the light was dazzling. An elegant noble lady soon revealed herself.

Not in her usual flamboyant dress, but in something close to casual wear, as if she had briefly stepped out.

The door closed behind her.

Helmut, who had been frozen, gave a brief greeting.

“I greet Your Grace, the Duchess.”

To come looking for him at such an hour. It was uncharacteristic of her cautious nature. There must have been something she wanted to confirm.

His heart pounded faster.

But just like Helmut, who maintained his outward composure, her expression remained serene.

Margret spoke calmly.

“I heard you train at this hour every day.”

Helmut’s room was frequently visited by attendants. Perhaps they were also there to monitor him.

Helmut usually informed the attendant when he came down to train with his sword.

“Yes.”

“I don’t have much time… I have something to ask. Will you answer me?”

Margret didn’t hesitate and got straight to the point.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa didn’t have much time to move without being noticed.

To avoid anyone noticing, she had carefully come here.

Helmut nodded.

“Please ask.”

“Show me the mark you mentioned earlier.”

“Yes.”

Margret didn’t explain the reason, and Helmut didn’t ask. He simply moved.

He approached the cloak placed in one corner of the training ground and searched the pockets. From his hand, a golden object was drawn.

Seeing the dented surface of the pendant, Margret’s eyes trembled like the surface of water.

As if something had caught in the net of memory.

“This is it.”

Margret snatched the pendant with trembling hands.

The lid opened, and she saw her own image drawn inside. As her mind recognized it, strength left her hands.

Clang! The pendant fell to the floor, heavily reverberating through the air.

Margret was now trembling all over. Her gaze, which had been fixed on the pendant, lifted.

A voice overflowing with all sorts of emotions escaped her lips.

“Helmut.”

Her two hands, which had uttered his name like a groan, stretched out towards the void.

Helmut embraced his mother who was coming to hug him. The embrace was very warm.

No, it wasn’t her that was warm. It felt like his insides were burning.

“Helmut.”

His mother called again with a voice mixed with sobs. Calling her returned child.

She was crying. Her shoulder, wet with tears, was warm.

It felt like dawn breaking. Helmut felt as if he had lived for this moment.

Alea’s warning was forgotten, and Helmut realized that this was inevitable for him.

It was decided from the moment he chose to come to Renosa, no, from the moment he saw his mother.

If he had to pay a price for this moment, he would gladly pay it.

That was his resolution and determination.



H.F.C Chapter 243 ( Part 1):

`				`“How did you come to have the pendant?”

“The one who took me in after I was abandoned in the Forest of Roots later gave it to me.”

Margret and Helmut continued their conversation. It was mainly Margret asking questions and Helmut answering.

He needed to explain from the beginning, but somehow his throat felt tight.

Moreover, he wasn’t sure if Margret would be able to accept the entire truth, which is why it turned out this way.

‘I wonder how Mother will think of Elaga.’

A leopard the size of a house, and a demonic beast at that. Margret was a noblewoman who had lived a graceful life and was different from Alea, who could be flexible in her thinking as a mage. Helmut knew at least that much.

Before long, Margret’s tears had stopped. She was holding Helmut’s hand tightly and listening intently to his words.

Her blue eyes warmly embraced him, as if urging him to continue speaking with trust.

“You say you are the disciple of Sword Saint Darien?”

“Yes.”

“That’s remarkable. The bloodline of Renosa has always excelled in swordsmanship.”

Now it was time to ask how he had come out of the forest.

But suddenly, Margret frowned.

“I think we need to stop here. It seems difficult for me to stay away any longer. I must return.”

Margret had secretly slipped away. Now it was time for her to go back.

“Yes.”

“Rest. We’ll talk again next time.”

Helmut watched Margret’s figure as she turned around, composing her disheveled expression.

The door opened and closed, leaving him alone in the training ground.

It felt as though he had awakened from a dream.

But the lingering emotions remained.

It was a night that felt as if he had gained everything. Somehow, he wanted to talk to someone.

‘Alea said she wouldn’t be able to contact me.’

She must be conducting a long, focused experiment with the dungeon.

For the first time, Helmut felt a clear sense of dissatisfaction with his girlfriend.

“…She’ll probably contact me soon.”

Until then, he had no idea how things with his mother would unfold.

\*

Michael had grown quite close to Leon. Michael had an exceptional talent for winning people’s hearts.

Michael acted as if he had a purpose in recruiting Leon into the Black Wing Knights.

On the other hand, he behaved as if Helmut, merely the winner of the lower-grade tournament, wasn’t even worth considering.

Leon was a high-ranking noble with a lofty attitude, a boy who had always lived as an honor student.

He was not the type to easily open his heart, but he couldn’t resist Michael’s blatant favoritism and eloquence.

While having tea with Leon, Michael skillfully guided the conversation to his desired topic.

“You must have swung your sword a lot during the tournament. How about getting it checked? Ratona’s blacksmith is quite good. I heard some competitors bought their swords from Ratona.”

Leon responded nonchalantly.

“Helmut did. His previous sword seemed like a fine blade, so I wonder why he suddenly changed it.”

It was the answer Michael had been hoping for.

“Is that so? Maybe his sword was damaged?”

“It was fine when we sparred on the way here… Ah, never mind.”

Leon hastily closed his mouth. Michael could guess the outcome of their sparring from his attitude.

Michael’s eyes narrowed. But he smoothly let it pass without pressing the issue.

“I see. He must have found a sword he liked.”

A short while later, Michael naturally concluded the conversation and left. He had heard what he wanted.

It was something he could have found out more quickly, but he did not rush. Michael walked, lost in thought.

‘So, he did change his sword. Where could his previous sword be?’

It was a Sword Saint’s sword. It wouldn’t be left just anywhere. He would always carry it. Perhaps in a cloak with spatial expansion magic.

Hyde also had one. Helmut wouldn’t have expected to see Michael in Renosa.

So, he wouldn’t have bought a new, expensive cloak with spatial expansion magic.

Even a stealthy entry into Helmut’s room to inspect his belongings would remove any doubt that Helmut was Hyde.

Michael realized one thing.

‘Charlotte must have known. She’s hiding something too.’

It was an unpleasant thought. Charlotte didn’t trust Michael.

Michael knew this well. Yet, it was unacceptable that she was hiding something from him.

Michael also understood Charlotte’s nature.

Charlotte was raised as the Grand Duke’s daughter. She knew she shouldn’t easily give her heart to others and indeed had a detached side.

Charlotte was hiding the truth from Michael to protect Helmut.

She didn’t want Michael to harm Helmut.

‘She wouldn’t go to such lengths to protect just a skilled commoner senior.’

Michael pressured Charlotte as if it were related to the Grand Duchy’s security.

Yet, she kept silent, indicating she held Helmut in special regard. It wasn’t romantic interest.

‘Does Charlotte feel something similar to what I feel?’

They were twins. Unfortunately, there was no such thing as empathy between them, but he could guess. Charlotte was simple-minded.

‘What worries me more is Mother.’



H.F.C Chapter 243 ( Part 2):

`				`A child who might be the Grand Duke’s illegitimate offspring. The Grand Duke often left Ratona for long periods, leaving the Mother behind.

During those times, the Grand Duke could have had an affair.

What Michael found strange was something else.

He couldn’t believe that the thorough and cold-blooded Grand Duke would have allowed a Rinosa bloodline to grow up outside his control.

‘It’s unsettling to dismiss it as a collateral line.’

There was something nagging at him inside. An inexplicable feeling.

Michael had ordered an investigation into Helmut, but due to the short time, not much had been uncovered.

Greta Academy had stringent security.

Michael knew that before attending Greta Academy, Helmut had been a mercenary, and about his supporter, Instructor Ethan Kudrow, and his academy friends.

‘There might be more if we investigate further.’

Time was needed. What Michael couldn’t guess was why Helmut attended the academy.

Helmut was hiding himself. It was strange for someone of Renosa’s bloodline to hide.

Neither Michael nor Charlotte nor anyone knew Helmut was of Renosa’s bloodline.

At least no one would target Helmut for that reason. If there was another enemy, Michael didn’t know who they were or why they targeted Helmut.

‘For now, I’ll keep an eye on him.’

Finding out why Helmut was staying in Ratona was the urgent task. He must have a purpose.

If that purpose was to meet the Grand Duke and get his existence acknowledged.

‘Then I must take action somehow.’

He couldn’t just eliminate him. The Grand Duchess was not a mere figurehead.

Such an event wouldn’t be overlooked or tolerated in the palace. Also, Michael had no guarantee he could certainly eliminate Helmut. He could endanger himself.

Hyde was an extraordinary talent, and if Hyde was Helmut, it would take many of the Black Wing Knights to deal with him.

However, no matter how absent the Grand Duke was, moving the Black Wing Knights without the Grand Duchess’s consent was impossible for Michael.

So, even if he wanted to eliminate Helmut, there was no feasible means.

If he couldn’t harm him as an enemy, it would be advantageous in many ways to make him an ally.

‘I don’t want to eliminate him either.’

Michael admitted readily. Of course, this judgment was premised on Helmut not coveting the Rinosa heir position and not doing anything harmful to Rinosa.

‘Well then, let’s go.’

Michael’s footsteps moved. He said they should meet often, so it should be fine to go see him often.

He hadn’t asked for permission, but informing would suffice. This was Ratona, and Helmut was a guest. How to treat a guest was the host’s decision.

After recovering from his illness, he was fortunate not to fall sick for a while. Having handled accumulated tasks, now was the optimal time for Michael to move.

“Where is he?”

Michael’s question was soon answered. The garden. Michael headed there immediately.

However, at the entrance of the garden, he saw a familiar face.

“Your Highness Michael.”

“The head maid. Is Mother here?”

The head maid, directly serving the Grand Duchess. Her presence meant his mother had visited Helmut.

Michael’s eyes, still smiling, grew sharp.

‘What does Mother know?’

His mother was showing interest in Helmut. She was trying to find out who he was in a subtle way as the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Michael had thought simply.

But something was bothering him.

“I will inform the Grand Duchess.”

“No, wait.”

Just then, he saw his mother. Michael looked at his mother standing in the garden from a distance.

Helmut was hidden behind a tree, so he could only see his mother’s side profile.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa was a wise and merciful woman with a stern side to others. That was the dignity of a grand noble.

Michael’s gaze, looking at his mother, wavered.

Her eyes. The look in his mother’s eyes was unfamiliar.

No, it was familiar.

It was the same look she had when gazing at Charlotte or him. A look filled with affection.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa would never look at an illegitimate child with such eyes.

Something inside him twisted. Michael’s thoughts were wrong.

Mother wasn’t wary of him. She wasn’t seeking him as the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

‘Why?’

An ominous premonition rose and quickly consumed him. To Michael, this meant something unknown was happening in Renosa.

A memory suddenly flashed through his mind. The corridor of portraits. The portrait with the empty space. He seemed to remember hearing something about it.

Michael spoke to his mother’s maid.

“I’ve just remembered an urgent matter. You don’t need to inform Mother.”

Michael turned around on the spot. His expression had grown cold. He had something to investigate.

He had never unearthed a hidden past before, but it didn’t seem impossible.



H.F.C Chapter 244 (Part 1):

`				`For the few days after welcoming new guests, Ratona’s palace was quiet and peaceful.

However, it wasn’t a relaxed atmosphere where one could leisurely go out for a stroll.

Even if the guests were granted some freedom.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa lightly summoned the guests.

Instead of holding a grand hunting event, she organized a simple archery competition.

With so few participants, it could hardly be called a competition.

A couple of targets were set up, and her children and Leon gathered in one place.

A few Black Wing Knights who were confident in their archery skills were selected to join.

The atmosphere was somewhat tense and awkward.

Even though it was a gathering of three members of the Renosa bloodline, it was far from comfortable.

Helmut, Charlotte, Michael.

Charlotte, who couldn’t be free from Michael’s suspicions, had a stern expression.

She had been deliberately avoiding Helmut. Under the pretext of greeting the Black Wing Knight Commander and focusing on training.

But there was one thing she found strange.

‘I heard that Mother and senior have been spending a lot of time together lately. Why is Mother getting close to him? It seems excessive to be out of suspicion.’

While tilting her head at this uncharacteristic behavior from her mother, Charlotte couldn’t guess the reason.

She had stopped paying attention to Helmut altogether and hardly conversed with her mother.

It was impossible to fathom the intentions of the ever-calm Grand Duchess.

“Please, come in.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa welcomed them with her usual benevolent smile.

The real reason she had arranged this event was to give her children a chance to bond under the pretext of a competition.

She wasn’t unaware that Michael was wary of Helmut.

Also, she hadn’t reached a conclusion on how to deal with Helmut.

Margret had been spending time visiting Helmut for the past few days.

Just following her heart.

The Grand Duke of Renosa was absent, and she had postponed her duties, decisions, and judgments as the Grand Duchess.

The child she thought she had lost forever had returned. Margret just wanted to be a mother to Helmut.

She felt new emotions every day, too insufficient to be called joy.

As if a part of her that had died was coming back to life.

Helmut’s return was the one miracle that had occurred in her life.

A completely unexpected miracle.

She had never earnestly prayed for it. The Grand Duchess of Renosa was too important a position to expect miracles, and grief had to be buried quickly.

‘I want to focus on the present, no matter what happens in the future.’

She wanted to spend time together, lavishing the affection she couldn’t give to the child she had lost.

Margret was Helmut’s mother. She hoped her firstborn would mingle with his siblings.

Of course, since Michael and Charlotte were completely unaware of this fact, they would be suspicious of Margret’s behavior.

‘I can only hope they’ll naturally be drawn to their own blood.’

Of the two younger siblings, at least Charlotte was more friendly towards Helmut. She had always been close to Helmut.

As soon as she saw Helmut, she bowed her head slightly, just as she had done at the academy.

“Senior Leon, Senior Helmut, have you been well?”

“Ah, yes.”

The atmosphere seemed to disregard the fact that she was the Duchess and Helmut was merely a commoner.

Helmut tilted his head as he looked at Charlotte.

“You look like a woman.”

Charlotte was wearing a dress. Not a simple, ordinary one, but an elaborate dress befitting the Duchess of the prosperous Renosa.

With her abundant black hair flowing down and adorned with jewels, Charlotte looked like a completely different person.

Yes, truly like a woman.

Leon, standing at a distance, spoke as if he was rather flustered.

“W-What disrespectful words to Her Highness the Grand Duchess.”

He flinched when he received Helmut’s gaze. He was still wary of Helmut. Charlotte smiled brightly.

“Please be at ease. While I’m attending the academy, I’ll just be Charlotte.”

“That means you’ll become Her Highness Charlotte after graduation.”

“Yes, that’s unavoidable. I am the Duchess of Renosa, after all.”

“I see.”

Helmut accepted it calmly. Although he wasn’t familiar with the human-specific system of status, there were countless unfamiliar things in the human world since he came out. There was nothing particularly new about it.

“Everyone seems to get along well. But I hope you won’t forget that I’m not an academy student.”

Michael, who appeared last, threw out words with a smile.



H.F.C Chapter 244 (Part 2):

`				`Michael was the Duke of Rinosa, and he didn’t speak comfortably with either Helmut or Leon.

However, Helmut received special treatment. He was the only commoner here.

Leon brightened up at him.

“Your Highness Michael. How have you been feeling?”

“I’m healthy. More than ever.”

Helmut faced Michael. He had heard that the day before yesterday, or was it, Michael had come and gone while he was in the garden with his mother.

He didn’t know why Michael had just left, but it was clear that Michael didn’t much like seeing him together with his mother.

He was a guy with many issues. Michael’s smile sank more coldly than before.

Despite saying he wanted to see him often, he didn’t pay much attention to Helmut.

However, Helmut didn’t think Michael had completely lost interest in him.

‘He’s probably intensely investigating my background.’

Helmut had been careful to erase his tracks. Even the formidable Black Hawk couldn’t discern where he came from.

The legend of the Forest of Roots, where no one who entered came out, blinded human eyes.

It was an unshakeable, powerful prejudice.

Helmut didn’t think Michael was an exception. Although he couldn’t be completely at ease.

“Do you know how to shoot a bow?”

Helmut asked without much thought. Michael’s expression wavered.

“Helmut.”

Leon called his name softly, seeming flustered. He had grown bolder since getting close to Michael.

“Do you think I can’t shoot a bow just because I can’t handle a sword?”

“Yes.”

Helmut answered without hesitation. It wasn’t particularly out of disrespect, but just the apparent fact.

It didn’t seem like Michael’s slender, girlish hands could properly pull a strong bowstring.

Michael’s smile turned fierce.

“Unfortunately, I do know how to shoot a bow. It’s one of my few active hobbies.”

“I see.”

Responding halfheartedly, Helmut guessed that Michael would surely use a magic bow.

That was true. Michael was skilled at compensating for his lack of physical abilities in other ways.

But anyway, to hit the target with an arrow, one needs a certain level of skill.

“Are you confident in your archery skills, Helmut?”

“Senior Helmut’s skills are amazing. He can easily shoot down birds flying in the sky.”

Charlotte intervened subtly. She had seen Helmut hunting during their camping trip.

“In that case, I look forward to it. Shall we make a bet? On your victory or someone else’s. The one who scores the highest with ten arrows wins.”

Michael smiled softly. Helmut didn’t bother to ask about the stakes of the bet. He simply said,

“It’s better not to make bets you’ll lose.”

His tone was calm, as if giving advice. It was so nonchalant that it seemed to ask why they were doing such a foolish thing.

Michael’s expression wavered once again. It was an answer that left him both dumbfounded and at a loss for words.

“That’s quite some confidence. Are you saying you can hit the bullseye with all ten arrows?”

“Of course.”

The answer was so firm that everyone was at a loss for words. The Grand Duchess of Rinosa, who had been listening, chuckled softly.

“Then would you show us your skills? Instead of making a bet, I’ll give a prize to the winner. I haven’t thought of anything yet, but it will be a sufficient reward.”

“If you wish.”

Helmut answered briefly. It was an attitude that seemed arrogant even though he was telling the truth.

But Helmut’s job was simply to prove his words. The Grand Duchess of Rinosa smoothly deflected.

“I look forward to it.”

The guests’ turn was later. To liven up the atmosphere, the knights shot their arrows first.

They were Black Wing Knights. Their archery skills were indeed excellent. The scores ranged from 1 to 10 points, increasing towards the center, and the target was quite detailed in its scoring.

But they hit their arrows close to the center almost every time. 10 points, 9 points, 8 points. They never went below 7 points.

“How about having Helmut go last? He seems confident.”

Michael suggested. It was a calculation that the person shooting last would feel pressure thinking about the scores of those who went before.

But Helmut was someone who wouldn’t be affected by such pressure at all. He nodded slightly.

“I don’t mind.”

He then stepped forward with ten arrows. Charlotte’s archery skills were also excellent. True to her honor student status, Charlotte scored a decent 90 points. It was similar to the Black Wing Knights’ performance.

Unexpectedly, Leon didn’t seem to have much talent for archery. Most of his arrows were evenly distributed across almost all score ranges.

Having hit the 10-point mark with only one arrow, he explained with a perplexed face.

“I haven’t done much of this kind of thing.”

Naturally, he drifted away from the winning ranks.

The order right before Helmut was Michael.

Michael raised his personal magic bow. It might seem like cheating, but no one objected to the Duke of Renosa doing so.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa also seemed to turn a blind eye to his unfairness as if it were natural. In an instant, ten arrows cut through the air and were shot.

“98 points.”

Michael smiled, narrowing his eyes. It was a triumphant smile.

He could confidently claim to be the best archer in Renosa.

Although he had nothing to boast about regarding almost everything related to physical prowess, even if he borrowed the power of magic, there was no one with superior skills in archery than him.

The result wouldn’t change even if someone else held his bow.

His magic bow only slightly enhanced strength, not controlling the delicate use of that power or angle calculations.

Unless someone hit the bullseye with almost all arrows, Michael’s victory seemed certain.

Helmut lightly picked up the bow.

And the moment he shot all ten arrows, a change occurred in what seemed to be a predetermined result.



H.F.C Chapter 245 (Part 1):

`				`The first arrow hit the center of the target.

10 points. And the second arrow broke the first arrow and lodged itself precisely in the same spot.

The same thing happened repeatedly. Until all 10 arrows were embedded in the target, everyone watched Helmut’s skills without being able to look away.

It was an unbelievable feat.

Despite not using Vis, the strength with which he drew the bowstring carried formidable power.

Enough to shatter the arrows already lodged in the target. When Helmut drew the bowstring for the last arrow, the target, which had been precariously standing, toppled backward with a thud.

A servant ran to check the arrows embedded in the target and shouted.

“10 points!”

A perfect score of 100 points. A profound silence fell over the surroundings in the wake of the astounding feat.

It was an overwhelming moment that went beyond merely excellent skill.

“It seems I have won.”

Helmut cast a nonchalant glance at Michael.

Michael raised a painted smile on his pale face.

“Your archery skills are amazing. I’m glad I didn’t make a bet.”

A talent to be envied, no, more than that. It was exceedingly exceptional. As if alive.

Such a person is not meant to be under anyone. He was not someone to be wielded as a sword at another’s whim.

This was regardless of how great the capacity of the master might be.

Helmut was never meant to be that way. Michael vividly felt that.

Helmut nodded. Charlotte also belatedly offered her congratulations.

“Senior Helmut, you’re truly impressive.”

“It seems Helmut is the winner.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa, who had been watching Helmut with surprise, was now smiling.

Her gaze toward Helmut held a gentle affection. It was a change that a sensitive person could notice.

“What should we give as a prize?”

Just as the Grand Duchess, who had been silently pondering, was about to speak again.

“Your Highness, the Grand Duchess!”

A loud cry echoed. A knight urgently rushed in from afar.

He was dressed in the uniform of the Black Wing Knights. His demeanor was so unusual that no one reprimanded his rudeness.

“It’s an urgent message!”

“What is it?”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa responded gracefully, raising her eyebrows. The knight glanced around.

Leon and Helmut, who were outsiders, stood plainly there. It was not something to be spoken aloud in front of outsiders. It was quicker to clear people out than to change the location.

The Grand Duchess ordered that the prize for the winner would be decided later and that everyone should disperse.

With that, the archery competition she had hosted concluded.

Helmut and Leon left immediately.

Of course, Leon was indifferent, but Helmut listened attentively.

Using Vis, he could hear conversations from a distance.

“Report. What’s the matter?”

After a few minutes of impatient waiting, the knight finally spoke.

“His Highness, the Grand Duke, has gone missing!”

“What did you say…?”

At that moment, the Grand Duchess’s face showed intense agitation. As if she had heard the palace had collapsed.

Michael and Charlotte’s faces also froze.

Helmut briefly glanced at his mother. The Grand Duchess spoke with a pale face.

“Let’s discuss this inside.”

\*

“There was an ambush.”

In a tense atmosphere, the report continued in the presence of the Grand Duchess of Renosa, Charlotte, and Michael.

The Grand Duke of Renosa usually did not inform the Grand Duchess of his detailed whereabouts.

He would generally say he was going to inspect certain areas and that he would be back after a certain period, asking her to take care of the palace.

That was all he would say.

The Grand Duke cherished the Grand Duchess but cherished Renosa even more.

As a rare ruler who meticulously inspected every corner of Renosa, his schedule always had many variables.

This incident was also a result of those variables.

“There was a report of strange occurrences in the mountain range extending from the empire to Renosa. His Highness was inspecting a nearby mine and decided to personally look around the mountain. That’s the last report we have before this incident. And…….”

The knight continued solemnly.

“Something happened there.”



H.F.C Chapter 245 (Part 2):

`				`“What do you mean something happened?”

“His Highness was moving with a small elite group. However, not long after, signal flares were launched from the mountain, and the nearby troops headed there.

Up until that point, we did not think anything unusual would happen. His Highness was accompanied by fifteen members of the Black Wing Knights, after all.

But when the troops arrived, all they could see was dug-up ground and bodies. Torn apart bodies of the Black Wing Knights.

Seven have been confirmed. This incident occurred just a few hours ago, and this report was only recently delivered to the palace. The thick fog made it impossible to search further. We await your orders on how to proceed.”

The Grand Duchess’s lips trembled. Charlotte and Michael’s eyes also showed shock.

Especially Michael, who had wiped away his usual smile entirely.

Had they ever faced such a crisis before?

Charlotte shouted as if vomiting her words.

“Who could have done such a thing!”

“As I mentioned earlier, strange phenomena have been occurring. A hunter in a nearby village, barely alive, spoke of a ‘beast.’ It’s possible that some terrifying magical beast has appeared along the mountain range.”

The reporting knight lowered his head as if guilty.

“So, His Highness’s safety remains unconfirmed?”

“Yes. The frequent fog makes it difficult to search. Several soldiers dispatched to the mountain have already gone missing. We need elite forces.”

It was a foregone conclusion that all members of the Black Wing Knights guarding this Ratona place, including the commander, would be deployed.

But that alone was insufficient. The current missing person was the ruler of Renosa. The Grand Duchess, calming her shock, thought rationally.

“We need not only elite forces but also someone to assess the situation. We cannot just sit here and wait not knowing what has happened to His Highness.”

The Grand Duchess spoke decisively.

“I must go personally.”

Michael and Charlotte simultaneously looked at their mother. They were surprised but for different reasons than before. Michael was the first to object.

“With His Highness missing, it’s unacceptable for you to leave the palace too, Mother.”

“Indeed, Mother should stay and protect the palace.”

Charlotte agreed. But the Grand Duchess shook her head.

“Someone has to go there. It could be dangerous. If that’s the case, I think it’s right that I go, not you two who are to inherit Renosa.”

Margret was also a mother. She could not send both Charlotte and Michael.

If someone had to go, it should be Charlotte, not Michael, who couldn’t wield a sword.

But Margret could not allow that either. She could not risk losing either of her children. It was almost an obsession.

Moreover, without revealing Helmut’s existence, if Charlotte were to die in an unfortunate accident, Michael would be left alone to inherit Renosa.

Assuming the Grand Duke was dead, it would be a simplified succession line, but it would be extremely unfair.

Although the Grand Duchess acted as if she supported Michael, she could not support such an outcome.

It was a decision worthy of the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

However, if she could not risk her children, Charlotte, too, could not risk her mother.

Charlotte was a swordswoman. A strong swordswoman. One who would not retreat and would fight to the death against any enemy.

A swordswoman wields a sword to win, to protect with her own hands, to achieve what she wants.

This was true even if she held the noble status of Grand Duchess.

Charlotte declared firmly.

“Mother, I will go. Please stay here with Michael and protect Ratona.”

“That cannot be. It’s too dangerous.”

“I can wield a sword. I am quite skilled and have good stamina. I can escape if it becomes too dangerous. But Mother cannot.”

Charlotte pointed out the truth. As a commander, Charlotte was the most suitable.

Michael was the same as his mother. His stamina was no different from the Grand Duchess’s. Going there without collapsing was the most he could help with.

Michael, being rational, knew his limits and did not step forward.

He was good at distinguishing between what he could and could not do.

This allowed him to avoid danger, but it was painful that he could not step forward in such a crucial moment as a successor.

If Charlotte succeeded in this mission, her position as a successor would be further strengthened.

Michael was more concerned about that than the possibility of the Grand Duke being dead.

The Grand Duchess knew it was the most appropriate but still shook her head.

“What if I lose you too?”

“There is a way.”

Charlotte was not reckless. Saving the Grand Duke was important, but minimizing sacrifice was essential.

She calmly devised a plan.

An idea flashed through her mind.

“Senior Helmut is at the palace. He is an incredible senior. I will go with Senior Helmut. If I explain the situation and ask for his help, I believe he will assist.”

Somehow, she felt safe with him. Helmut was the strongest swordsman she had ever seen. Perhaps even stronger than her master, the Black Wing Knights’ commander.

The Grand Duchess’s expression wavered. She soon nodded, knowing she had no choice.

“Alright.”



H.F.C Chapter 246 (Part 1):

`				`“Senior, I’m sorry for the request.”

Charlotte bowed her head slightly. She briefly explained her situation.

It seemed like a foregone conclusion that Helmut would accompany her.

Although he couldn’t refuse, Helmut felt a strange sensation after hearing her story.

Charlotte surely considered him close. But to try to recruit even a guest for such a dangerous and secret mission.

‘Should I call it practical? Or brazen?’

He was treated with great hospitality under the pretext of being the swordsmanship tournament winner.

Moreover, the Grand Duke of Renosa, though not present in his memories, was his father.

He couldn’t leave Charlotte in danger either. She was his sister, after all.

There was no absolute reason he couldn’t go. However.

‘The problem is parting with my mother again.’

That didn’t sit well with him. If the entire Black Wing Knights were mobilized, the capital would be relatively empty. Michael didn’t have the military strength to protect their mother.

Other knights and soldiers would remain to guard Ratona, but Helmut was concerned.

The very fact that he had to leave his mother in a situation where he couldn’t protect her.

Of course, he knew there was a simple way to resolve this confusion.

Defeat that mysterious beast and find the Grand Duke.

Even if the Grand Duke was already dead, then at least retrieve his body.

Although there would likely be turmoil until a new Grand Duke of Renosa took the position.

‘Michael will probably inherit the Grand Duke position.’

Charlotte would want Renosa’s chaos to end as quickly as possible, and Michael would never want to give up the Grand Duke position.

It was obvious which of the two would step down – the one with less ambition.

If Michael became Grand Duke, Helmut’s position would become even more ambiguous.

Their mother didn’t seem likely to let go of Helmut, but she can’t forcibly keep him against Michael’s opposition either.

Once Michael became the master of Renosa, there would be limits to what she could do.

‘I need to move as quickly as possible at this point. There’s no time to hesitate.’

The best option was to rescue the Grand Duke. He didn’t need to be responsible for his mother’s safety.

Charlotte, understanding Helmut’s hesitation somehow, gently urged him again.

“Still, you should help your junior, right?”

For some reason, her request was confident. Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Even when asking someone for a favor, her confidence never wavered.

Helmut gave a distant reply.

“I’m a mercenary by origin. Will you pay the commission fee?”

Helmut wasn’t the type to simply follow along or freely offer goodwill to others.

Though a guest in this palace, he had a cool-headed personality that took care of his own interests.

Charlotte likely thought the same.

And Charlotte wasn’t stingy when it came to paying.

“Of course. I’ll pay you a generous commission fee on the honor of the Grand Duke’s family. Although that’s not for me to decide.”

When Helmut showed his willingness to agree, Charlotte smiled brightly before her face turned serious again.

“Mother wishes to have a private conversation with you.”

“Alright.”

“We’ll depart immediately after. Please be prepared. We don’t have much time.”

Charlotte left immediately, saying she needed to prepare for departure as well.

She seemed surprisingly composed for someone who had just learned of her father’s disappearance.

As a member of the grand nobility ruling a country, one must maintain composure in any situation.

Moreover, Charlotte was a strong swordswoman. She had already steeled herself mentally.

Helmut looked around the luxurious room assigned to him.

There wasn’t much to pack. His preparation ended with taking his sword.

Would something be different when he returned here? It was impossible to know yet.

With a premonition, Helmut left the room.



H.F.C Chapter 246 (Part 2):

`				`“Will you be alright?”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa he faced asked quietly. Mother’s blue eyes gazed at Helmut, distorted with concern.

“It will be dangerous.”

“You want me to go, right?”

Helmut replied calmly. He wasn’t blaming her.

If his mother wanted it, Helmut had to go.

She was Helmut’s mother, and that alone gave her the right to command him. That right was virtually absolute.

They say children who are neglected by their parents become more devoted in order to be loved.

Helmut was even abandoned.

Though it probably wasn’t his mother’s intention. That’s why he wanted to show his strength, to prove he was a child capable of fulfilling his mother’s wishes and more.

Perhaps Helmut wanted to prove his necessity to his mother. To avoid being abandoned again.

“Of course, I do. But I also don’t.”

With a sorrowful expression, his mother continued slowly.

“I am the Grand Duchess of Renosa. I have a duty to make choices for Renosa.”

Her wavering heart had firmed. She was thinking not as a mother, but as the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

“I heard you were planning to go yourself. I understand that Charlotte and I going is the best choice.”

Helmut thought so too. His mother was far from being capable in combat. Against such powerful beasts, she would only be a burden.

In fact, Charlotte wasn’t much different. If he went with her, Helmut would have to consider her safety as well.

Moving alone would be most convenient, but Helmut understood that someone from the Renosa Grand Duke’s family with the authority to command troops needed to accompany him.

“Don’t be disappointed. I think this is a good opportunity.”

Helmut understood what his mother was trying to say.

This was an appropriate opportunity for Helmut to be accepted as a member of Renosa.

Achieving merit. If Helmut rescued the Grand Duke of Renosa, the Grand Duke could accept him more easily as well.

Although Helmut couldn’t be officially recognized due to the Temple, he could be accepted unofficially at least.

Even if it meant risking antagonizing the Temple.

If the Temple found out, Helmut could simply leave on his own.

Renosa could claim they didn’t know he still had the Dark Seed.

Helmut appeared normal on the outside, and he was an honor student attending the academy normally in Baden.

‘With Alea, and her master Heike who is also a Temple public enemy, living away from the Temple’s eyes isn’t difficult. Even without confronting them directly.’

Thinking positively, it wasn’t that dangerous.

The Temple is hostile to those with the Seed of Darkness.

But recently two High Priests died. The Temple’s power has weakened, and they’re in conflict with Basor.

They couldn’t afford to make an enemy of Renosa as well.

Although the Temple and the Empire are still on good terms, the Temple couldn’t exert absolute influence on any country.

Renosa might face some disadvantages, but they wouldn’t be too severe.

If they threatened Renosa, Helmut was ready to destroy the Temple at any time.

He knew two high-ranking temple enemies, both archmages.

Basor’s Luke Yeager also owed Helmut.

Though he had never formed a faction before, Helmut felt it wouldn’t be impossible.

After all, Helmut was born with the bloodline of rulers. He was the legitimate heir of Renosa with noble blood.

“Just as Charlotte believes in your skills, I believe in them too. Though I don’t have the eye to judge a swordsman’s ability, Charlotte has high standards.”

In some ways, his mother was fair. She initially offered to go herself, unafraid of losing her life.

But Charlotte stepped up, saying it would be better if she went instead. Suggesting a better option.

The Grand Duchess agreed to that persuasion ultimately because it was the choice befitting a Grand Duchess.

For Margret, motherly affection couldn’t surpass duty.

If Charlotte had to take risks, Helmut could too.

Michael was left out of this calculation because he was weak, not for any other reason.

“And if possible, could you make sure Charlotte doesn’t get hurt?”

“I will.”

Helmut readily agreed. Defeating the mysterious powerful beast and rescuing the Grand Duke.

And protecting Charlotte. These were the two duties given to him.

To some, it might feel like a mountain of responsibility.

“I believe in you.”

With those brief words, his mother willingly passed that weight onto Helmut.

Though she said it couldn’t be helped, she was the one who had abandoned him. There was no time for tenderness.

But Helmut was also a member of Renosa. That’s what bloodline means to grand nobility.

Just by being born with that blood, one shoulders responsibilities.

His mother was recognizing him in her own way.

His strength, and the fact that he too was a member of the Grand Duke’s family.

Strangely, Helmut could clearly feel this fact. And surprisingly, he felt no aversion to it.

“I’ll see you when I return.”

With those final words, Helmut rose from his seat.

There was no time to delay. Once decided, they would move as quickly as possible.

Helmut soon joined the troops led by Charlotte. A grave expression colored everyone’s faces.

“I hope you both return safely.”

Michael, uncharacteristically without a smile, saw them off.

His face was strange, not simply cold.

Helmut and Charlotte standing opposite him looked like siblings even to strangers.

In contrast, Michael looked like an outsider, not mixed with their blood.

“Take care, Charlotte.”

As he said those words, Michael’s gaze shifted. His eyes twisted slightly as he looked at Helmut.

After a moment, Michael uttered:

“And you too, Helmut.”

“Yes.”

Helmut replied briefly.

With that, they immediately left Ratona and set out for where the Grand Duke had disappeared.



H.F.C Chapter 247 (Part 1):

`				`‘Where am I….’

Several days had passed since the Seed of Darkness had bloomed.

However, he was still a Platinum Mercenary. Vis is the power of the mind.

He hadn’t completely lost his sanity yet. Occasionally, his rationality returned.

He blinked. As the pitch-black darkness that veiled his vision brightened, he became aware of himself.

A monster drenched in blood. The aura of dark energy seeping out of his body tainted the grass around him a murky color.

His moments of sanity were becoming increasingly rare.

Eventually, his reason would never surface again.

Even so, there was nothing he could do.

The water had already overflowed, and even an Archmage couldn’t reverse it.

He might eventually merge with his instincts and become an even more brutal demonic beast.

But one thing was clear: he was no longer his own master.

He became aware of himself, perched on a tree, frozen like a statue.

He was injured. His whole body ached. It seemed his nerves weren’t completely numb, as he could still feel pain.

He jerked his head around recklessly, trying to shake off the chains that bound him, but it was futile. The feeling of being consumed was chilling.

Yet, even knowing he couldn’t resist, he didn’t wish to end his enslaved life.

Those who gained life through the Seed of Darkness clung desperately to it.

Becoming beasts, they lost themselves, slaughtering and destroying everything in sight.

Humans dominated by the instincts of dark energy were more savage than demonic beasts.

“Grr…”

This time, his physical body had taken a hit. While the Seed of Darkness was repairing his flesh, he momentarily regained his senses.

He looked around and noticed a torn-up corpse.

The blood, still warm, had not long ceased to flow, staining the ground.

‘Knights?’

He narrowed his eyes. A sword lay on the ground. A trained body. The attire was that of a black knight.

He recognized his opponent.

‘I killed… the Black Wing Knights.’

He grinned wickedly. A savage feeling welled up. Even as a Platinum Mercenary, facing such knights recklessly wasn’t an option.

Images he had seen but not registered came flooding back.

He remembered who he had fought.

‘The Grand Duke.’

The Grand Duke of Renosa. A grand noble who ruled the Principality of Renosa. The sight of him had filled him with a murderous rage.

He was originally a mercenary. A commoner.

Deep in his heart was resentment towards those of high status who controlled him with money.

He had targeted the Grand Duke but only managed to injure him in a surprise attack, failing to kill him.

The protection of the Black Wing Knights was fierce. They had torn his skin to shreds.

But he was strong. The Seed of Darkness had granted him incredible power.

He had torn apart several Black Wing Knights.

‘Where did he go….’

His beast-like eyes scanned the surroundings. He felt an odd thirst.

While some knights held him back, the other Black Wing Knights had carried off their bleeding master.

Sensing defeat, they scattered to protect their master.

In this thick fog, they wouldn’t know each other’s whereabouts.

He would find the Grand Duke. Would drinking his blood and ripping out his heart quench this thirst?

The savage demonic feeling rose. He licked his lips with his tongue.

“Grrr.”

A beastly growl escaped between his teeth, almost like laughter.

He began to move slowly.

In this fog, to find the master of Renosa.

They couldn’t have gone far.

\*

It was a dark cave. A small cave near a cliff, hidden by bushes.

The entrance was narrow, but the inside was relatively spacious.

It could fit a few people inside.

There were four people inside. Four adult men squeezed together, speaking in hushed tones.

“What kind of monster is that?”

One of the Black Wing Knights muttered. His face showed tension and fear.

Memories of fleeing with their master, leaving their comrades fighting desperately, resurfaced.

Only after escaping a considerable distance and hiding here could they sigh with relief.

“Be quiet! It might follow us.”

A comrade warned. Sweat beaded on their spines. They had survived because they were closest to the Grand Duke. It wasn’t that they were specifically chosen.

“Your Highness, the Grand Duke.”



H.F.C Chapter 247 (Part 2):

`				`One of the knights checked on the Grand Duke. His complexion was pale, unconscious.

There was a long wound on the Grand Duke’s abdomen. As if a giant leopard’s paw had clawed through.

The bleeding had stopped somewhat, but it wasn’t a wound that would heal naturally.

The moment something flew towards them like a ball, the Grand Duke became half-dead.

It was a miracle he didn’t die instantly. Protecting the Grand Duke from the next blow was all the Black Wing Knights, standing like scarecrows, could do.

One knight assessed calmly.

“The bleeding has stopped, but he’s lost too much blood. No matter how robust he is, he needs treatment and rest.”

“For the Grand Duke’s sake, we need to leave this place as soon as possible.”

“What do you suggest we do?”

Silence fell at the question from one near the entrance. They needed to move the Grand Duke for treatment. But out there in the fog was the beast that had slaughtered the Black Wing Knights.

The knights had split up instinctively, knowing they couldn’t flee together.

There was no time to escape to a village. They just needed to get as far away from the beast as possible.

Finding this hideout was a miracle.

They had erased all traces at the entrance.

They could only hope the creature couldn’t track the scent of the Grand Duke’s blood.

“Instead of all moving together, it’s better to call for help. Bring someone, preferably a mage.”

They continued their low-voiced conversation. They had to decide their next steps.

They weren’t of ranks to give commands to each other.

“There’s no way we three can handle that thing.”

“One should stay, and the other two should move.”

“But we need to know the location of this place to tell where the Grand Duke is.”

“The problem is we don’t know where we are either. Can we even determine a direction in this foggy mountain?”

“That’s a fair point. This fog won’t stay thick forever. It’s better to move when it clears a bit.”

“News must have reached Ratona. Support troops will arrive soon and start a search.”

“If the Knight Commander comes…”

Hope showed on their faces.

Even among the Black Wing Knights, the Commander who guards the system and the knights under him were highly skilled.

Those who came here were just escorts accompanying the Grand Duke on a light outing. They hadn’t anticipated such danger.

“Let’s stay as quiet as mice until the fog clears.”

Fortunately, they had been camping, so each had a bit of dried food on them. They could hold out for a while.

When the opportunity arose, they would leave this place. A day or two. The Grand Duke should be able to hold out until then.

They spent the night on high alert, filled with anxiety.

\*

The troops that had left the capital moved through a magic circle.

Four Black Wing Knights had returned to the main force. They were the ones who managed to maintain their sense of direction even in the fog.

Out of fifteen, seven had died, and four had returned.

The whereabouts of the remaining four were unknown. They didn’t even know how many were with the Grand Duke.

It was a devastating outcome. Never had there been an enemy inflicting such damage on the Black Wing Knights.

Charlotte’s face darkened.

“It’s a terrifying magical beast. How did such a creature end up in Renosa?”

Charlotte frowned, not out of fear.

Rescuing the Grand Duke from that creature in the forest seemed overwhelming.

“Wouldn’t it be better for you to stay here?”

Black Wing Knight Commander Alonso suggested. Even he, usually relaxed in front of his student Charlotte, had a slightly stern face.

“I don’t intend to push myself. I’ll stay by the Knight Commander’s side. Wouldn’t that be the safest? Also, while I may not be as skilled as the Black Wing Knights, I’d be more helpful in combat than regular soldiers. After all, even the soldiers will have to risk danger searching through the mountains.”

A larger group made searching easier. There would be sacrifices, but if the beast attacked, they would immediately know its location.

“There’s a lot of dark energy around here, making it hard to search with magic. It consumes a lot of magical power.”

The few mages were hired by Renosa.

They were quite skilled graduates from the Academy, but they had used a lot of magical power to move the many troops.

They had to reserve magical power for recovery magic. If the Grand Duke was injured, they would need to heal him.

Helmut, standing on one side, tilted his head.

‘It would be good if we could contact Alea.’

Alea would be an enormous force if she came.

But unfortunately, the incident occurred when she had cut off contact. It was regrettable, but nothing could be done.

Helmut raised his hand lightly. They were a large group that couldn’t move easily. Helmut was different.

“I’d like to move alone. I’ll act with signal flares.”

“Senior, it’s dangerous. The creature killed many Black Wing Knights. Even you can’t face it alone.”

Charlotte warned. But Helmut shook his head.

“No, I’ve fought many beasts. I’m used to fighting in the forest. In the worst case, I can at least save myself.”

Helmut wanted to go to ensure Charlotte’s safety.

Rather than dragging her along and fighting while protecting her, it was better to go alone and accomplish his goal.

With so many people around, Charlotte wouldn’t be in danger.

Helmut could venture into the forest, confront the demonic beast, and save the Grand Duke.

After all, he was his father. If he was still alive, he had to save him for his mother’s sake.

There was no time to waste.



H.F.C Chapter 248 (Part 1):

`				`The Black Wing Knights’ Commander, who had been quietly listening, stepped forward.

“Let him do as he wishes. Think of it as scouting ahead.”

An exceptional swordsman can gauge the skill of their opponent.

Although it wasn’t overtly expressed, Helmut possessed extraordinary skills.

He wouldn’t have any intention of harming the Grand Duke if he found him first.

Above all, Helmut resembled the Grand Duke so closely, even in the Knight Commander’s eyes. To the point of suspecting they were of the same bloodline.

Given the circumstances, he couldn’t speak of it openly.

Charlotte, upon hearing Alonso’s words, finally showed an expression of acceptance.

Though she had wanted to minimize any risk to their guest, now wasn’t the time to worry about such things.

All possible means had to be employed.

She looked earnestly at Helmut and spoke.

“I don’t want you to get caught up in this and end up in danger. Please, be careful.”

Ultimately, she was the one with the authority here, being of Renosa’s bloodline.

After a slight hesitation, Charlotte added firmly.

“And if possible, please save the Grand Duke.”

It was a heartfelt request. Helmut slowly nodded.

“Alright.”

Helmut promptly left the scene.

Following him, the soldiers dispersed into the now-thinning mist.

They maintained a close communication network to search for the beasts or the Grand Duke’s location.

Charlotte also moved along with the Black Wing Knights’ Commander.

Hoping they could secure the Grand Duke’s safety swiftly.

\*

In the mountains. How much time had passed?

As the fog thinned and the surroundings became clearer, he who had been hiding in a hollow old tree carefully moved.

His heart tightened with tension.

‘By now, support from Renosa should have arrived.’

Although he was a member of the Black Wing Knights, he wasn’t one who fought against demonic beasts, nor did he serve the Grand Duke directly.

He was one of those who had fled in different directions to disperse attention.

In the process, he had been separated from his comrades. He was the only one among the five who had fled but hadn’t returned to the main force.

Being alone in this dense fog, in a mountain infested with beasts that tore his comrades apart, was an experience that incited extreme fear.

It was like being enveloped in complete darkness, unable to see an inch ahead.

It wasn’t that he had wanted this or fled to save his own life. It just happened this way.

The reason he couldn’t escape and return to the main force wasn’t because he was particularly cowardly.

Vis was mental strength. Being a Black Wing Knight, he had the strength to endure fear.

‘I just can’t gauge the direction at all.’

It wasn’t that the other four who returned had an exceptional sense of direction; it wasn’t that his was particularly poor.

He realized he wouldn’t be able to find the right direction in this fog.

If a beast tracked him, he might die a meaningless death. So he chose to hide.

He couldn’t stay like this forever, so now was the time to move.

The safety of the Grand Duke or his comrades was now beyond his control.

‘Is it this way?’

The day had dawned, and the fog had cleared a bit, so he could roughly guess the direction based on the sun’s position.

He moved swiftly.

However, unfortunately, his movements were soon detected.

“Grrrr.”

A low growl came from the darkness. The growl, filled with demonic energy, made his limbs break out in goosebumps.

It was a sensation he had never experienced as a member of the Black Wing Knights, who had always been in the position of the hunter.

Now, he was the prey, and the enemy was the hunter.

A cruel and swift hunter.

An overwhelmingly powerful enemy was targeting him.

What that meant was inevitable death.

Fear that could paralyze his heart surged up. Before fleeing, he had seen the beast’s hand piercing his comrade’s body. The hand, imbued with demonic energy, had even shattered a sword.

To face such a creature alone.

“Grrrrrr.”

The sound and presence drew nearer simultaneously. Whether from the tree or the ground, he couldn’t tell. It was just coming like the wind.

‘Damn it!’

He kicked the ground with his frozen legs. He couldn’t just die meekly like this. Absolutely not.

At that moment, what engulfed him was fear.

And the hunt began.



H.F.C Chapter 248 (Part 2):

`				`Around the same time, decisions were being made in the hideout where the Grand Duke had taken refuge.

“Be careful. We need to move while suppressing our presence as much as possible. If we catch that thing’s attention…”

“I know.”

“I hope nothing happens here either. We’ll block the entrance to the hideout as we leave.”

“We must inform the main force of the Grand Duke’s location.”

Small but solemn voices exchanged words. The Grand Duke’s condition was deteriorating.

The Grand Duke was also a swordsman who handled Vis. Thanks to his robust body, he was barely holding on, but otherwise, he would have been teetering on the brink of life and death.

If left unattended, he would become critically ill. He needed treatment.

They couldn’t just hold out in the cold mountains with meager supplies.

They had to move immediately, no matter what.

“If time passes and we don’t return, then…”

“I’ll either move alone or take His Highness. I’ll decide then.”

The one who was to stay behind answered cautiously.

The slowest one was to stay and guard the Grand Duke.

The other two would move in different directions towards the main force.

One was to stay behind to protect the Grand Duke.

Monsters were a problem, but there was also the possibility of other beasts sneaking in and harming the unconscious Grand Duke.

“Let’s go.”

It was a path of uncertain survival, but a necessary one.

The two who stood up left the hideout immediately.

In the now silent hideout, the one who stayed behind could only wait.

\*

With every step, dense demonic energy could be felt.

It approached more densely than the now-thinned fog.

Helmut frowned.

‘This isn’t normal. No wonder seven Black Wing Knights were killed.’

It was hard to believe, but it seemed he might encounter a demonic beast capable of claiming its own territory even in the Forest of Roots.

It might not be on par with Elaga or Naho, but it was indeed a powerful beast.

‘They said it was close to a human form.’

Helmut had heard the survivor’s testimony before departing. About the beast that appeared out of nowhere.

It had a shape almost identical to a human, and its size was similar to that of a well-built adult male.

It was a puzzling fact.

Demonic energy enlarges the body. Strength fundamentally comes from weight and size.

Since demonic energy enhances that strength, the body, the source, also develops.

Both inside and outside the Forest of Roots, strong beasts were large. It was rare to find one that didn’t follow this rule.

‘Well, sometimes there might be small ones.’

Helmut shook his head. He didn’t know about all the demonic beasts in the Forest of Roots. But one thing was certain.

‘I can’t guarantee that it’s an opponent I can defeat.’

Helmut had never lost once in the human world. It was easy to think that he would naturally win.

Moreover, the opponent was a demonic beast. Slaying beasts was Helmut’s specialty.

But Helmut didn’t underestimate his opponent.

Both his reason and instincts told him of the enemy’s strength.

A sensation as if his skin was freezing. Tension rising spontaneously.

Even when facing the Palma Knights’ Commander, he hadn’t felt like this.

‘It’s been so long it’s almost unfamiliar.’

Helmut frowned. Even Helmut himself couldn’t guarantee victory if he were to face 15 Black Wing Knights.

But that beast had attacked the Grand Duke, killed seven, and driven the rest to flee.

According to testimony, its movements were very fast.

So when it suddenly appeared and attacked the Grand Duke, they couldn’t immediately block it.

‘Strong and fast too.’

He recalled past memories. When he took on an escort mission with the Pace Mercenary Corps through a beast-infested forest.

The leader monster there was quite strong too.

The strongest demonic beast Helmut had faced in the human world was the monkey beast he met there.

But even there, the demonic energy wasn’t this dense.

Despite the numerous beasts present there.

‘Whatever kind of beast it is, it’s leaving traces of demonic energy with every step.’

A demonic beast that naturally exudes demonic energy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

Although the Seed of Darkness had shrunk a bit after fighting the priests, Helmut had to avoid demonic energy.

Especially now, having met his mother.

His heart twitched somehow. The Seed of Darkness seemed to react to the demonic energy. Helmut was getting closer.

He just knew.

‘The smell of blood.’

Helmut reached for his sword. The sword drawn from his waist emitted a cool light.

It was a beast with explosive speed. It could attack at any moment. He couldn’t let his guard down.

The thick scent of blood wafted from afar.

Fresh blood, as if it had just been exposed to the air after piercing flesh.

It came almost within reach beyond the fog. Helmut’s senses had never been this keen before.

Helmut moved following his senses. Towards where the demonic energy was thickening.

Thanks to that, he found it properly. Something was there.

‘It’s the creature.’

If he couldn’t handle it alone, it would be right to mobilize troops.

Helmut now understood human combat methods. But at least he had to confirm its appearance.

‘Whether it’s the Grand Duke who’s dead, or a Black Wing Knight.’

If the smell of blood was this strong, there would be no use in rushing over.

Helmut walked at a pace that was neither slow nor fast. The fog was now distinctly thinner.

And finally, he saw something. The metallic smell of blood was overwhelming.

The creature, hunched over with its back turned, was unaware of Helmut.

Its back rose and fell continuously. Splat, splat. Blood spattered in the air.

Helmut soon confirmed a gruesome sight with his own eyes.

An ordinary human would have screamed and collapsed at the sight.

The creature was devouring a dismembered man’s body, bones and all.

At its feet lay half of a Black Wing Knight’s head. The other half, drenched in blood, still bore a vivid expression of terror.

He must have been murdered in utter horror. Unable to resist properly.



H.F.C Chapter 249 (Part 1):

`				`“Hey.”

At Helmut’s brief call, the creature’s movements came to an abrupt halt.

The sound of it ravenously devouring the corpse ceased completely.

Silence.

An eerie quietness settled.

Helmut silently observed the creature. It slowly turned its body. The moment stretched, feeling as slow as a snail’s crawl.

And in the next instant,

Boom! It felt as if his hand had been torn away. A barrier formed by Vis spread around his sword.

Nothing reached Helmut’s body, but blood and flesh scattered everywhere from the impact.

The creature had thrown the half-eaten corpse.

“Graaaah!”

As if to say, ‘How dare you interrupt my feast.’

Its eyes blazed fiercely with rage. Rough, panting breaths echoed.

Helmut frowned. He stood his ground, not dodging, to test the creature’s strength.

But its power was beyond his expectations.

No wonder it had been able to break through the Black Wing Knights and harm the Grand Duke.

With attacks at this speed, one might only realize after being hit.

‘This is an opponent I must use my full strength against from the start.’

Tension rose. Helmut sharply observed the creature.

Dark, cracked skin and swollen muscles. Blood-red eyes. Something like clothing draped around its waist.

The form couldn’t be called human, but the creature resembled a human more than expected.

Demonic beasts generally take on the form of some animal. An animal infused with demonic energy becomes a demonic beast.

So, what was this creature’s original form?

The question naturally arose, chilling his heart. An answer he didn’t want to consider surfaced within him.

As if confirming his suspicions, the creature shrugged its shoulders and cracked its neck, like a thug intimidating an opponent.

That gesture…

‘It can’t be.’

All the blood in his body went cold.

Helmut had seen beasts that resembled humans before. The monkey beast he had faced was like that.

But this was different.

The body size, movements, and the clothing it wore. Everything pointed to its original form.

‘A human.’

That word pierced his heart like a cold blade.

Boom! The creature didn’t give him time to think. A rock flew like a meteor and struck Helmut’s sword.

Even though he had drawn more Vis than before, the impact traveled past his grip and made his arm tingle.

It was undoubtedly a powerful demonic beast. One that would fit right into the Forest of Roots.

‘But I survived even in the Forest of Roots.’

There was no need to overthink. Just because it was a powerful beast didn’t mean it was unbeatable.

If the creature was strong, so was Helmut. Helmut raised his sword towards the creature.

The basic stance for unleashing the Sword Saint’s swordsmanship.

Now he knew the level of its attack power.

Knowing that, he could dodge next time. Blocking the creature’s strikes consumed a significant amount of Vis.

Seeing Helmut’s stance, the creature grinned widely.

After briefly looking around, it snapped a branch from a nearby tree.

As the thick branch passed through the creature’s hands, it was shaped into the form of a sword.

The creature pointed it at Helmut. That stance looked familiar.

‘Continental common swordsmanship.’

It felt like a nightmare becoming reality.

In an instant, the creature vanished from sight.

Its movements were so fast they blurred. Bang, crash, bang! It didn’t sound like branches and swords clashing.

Helmut parried half of the attacks and dodged the other half.

He intended to dodge all but couldn’t. It was impossible.

The creature’s attacks were so fast, it was as if they didn’t face air resistance.

With that much demonic energy in a human-sized body, its speed becomes explosively fast.

And one more thing.

Demonic beasts don’t use swordsmanship. But this creature did!

And at a very high level, thoroughly ingrained in its body!

‘As I thought.’

The attacks paused briefly. But Helmut couldn’t relax his guard.

Flexing his numb grip, Helmut had to admit.

This was once a human. Not an ordinary human.

Judging by its swordsmanship, it was a swordsman of considerable skill. One that wouldn’t have been easy to face even when it was human.

He couldn’t be sure if it had completely lost its sanity.

If it retained its intelligence merged with its vicious instincts, it was even more problematic.

It would have both the strengths of a human swordsman and a monster!

As the creature exuded demonic energy, the Seed of Darkness in Helmut’s heart wriggled. As if responding to the demonic energy.

No, it wasn’t demonic energy. It was recognizing a similar existence. The beast in front of him.

Yes, the creature had something similar to Helmut.

‘The Dark Seed.’



H.F.C Chapter 249 (Part 2):

`				`The realization was both chilling and numbing.

A human dominated by a dark seed, standing before him as a possible future for Helmut.

It was like staring into a terrifying mirror of the future.

Veins stood out on his pale hands. This was an opponent that was oppressive both physically and mentally.

The creature raised the corner of its mouth in a mocking smile at Helmut.

The malicious grin on its face would have terrified most people.

It was staring at the ashen Vis blooming from Helmut’s sword.

As if finally realizing what kind of being Helmut was.

The creature must have felt the Seed of Darkness within Helmut too.

But fortunately, the Seed of Darkness didn’t seem to recognize each other as comrades.

Demonic energy was a cruel and savage force. In the Forest of Roots, beasts constantly fought and devoured each other.

Even if peace was established by hierarchy, demonic beasts always sought to tear each other apart.

The Seed of Darkness was the essence of the instinct to kill. Even similar beings would annihilate each other.

Helmut’s Seed of Darkness stopped wriggling. As if it had never been uncooperative. This was a relief for Helmut.

‘Good. I don’t have to suppress the dark seed while fighting.’

The Seed of Darkness knew. If Helmut lost his life, his Seed of Darkness would also cease to exist.

A parasite couldn’t survive without its host.

After a moment, the attack resumed. The creature lightly tapped the ground and flew like an arrow.

It clearly showed Helmut what a human with a bloomed dark seed was like.

Why the temple regarded them as enemies and tried to kill them as babies. How ferocious and dangerous they were!

A powerful body, extensive combat experience, immense regenerative power, and the overwhelming demonic energy emanating from its entire being.

It was an opponent Helmut couldn’t claim superiority over in any aspect.

Had Helmut’s swordsmanship not been superior to the creature’s, even engaging it would have been impossible.

‘I’m grateful for the harsh training from Darien.’

Every nerve in his body was on edge. He couldn’t afford to let his guard down for a moment.

A single lapse could cost Helmut his life.

Meanwhile, the creature, with its monstrous body, had an absolute advantage.

Helmut’s strikes would hardly affect it.

The creature’s demonic energy protected its body from Helmut’s attacks, and even if it was wounded, it would quickly heal.

‘It needs to be a fatal blow.’

Aiming for the neck, head, or heart. Only targeting those areas could bring the creature down.

Since it was originally human, its vital points should be the same.

But the issue was piercing through the thick demonic energy enveloping its entire body and overcoming its rapid movements to strike it with his sword.

There wasn’t even a glimpse of an opening or gap. The creature appeared flawless.

And there was one more problem. Helmut’s sword was one he had bought in Ratona.

Helmut had never used Darien’s swordsmanship with that sword.

Of course. The sword was purchased for disguise, not for wielding the Sword Saint’s techniques.

The creature saw through this. Helmut’s flaw.

Bang, crack, shatter!

The sword in Helmut’s hand broke apart.

Fragments imbued with Vis scattered in all directions. Though he dodged them, one piece grazed Helmut’s cheek, drawing a line of blood.

The impact from the creature’s strike had been too much for the sword.

It was a sword purchased in Ratona. It was a decent sword, but not a legendary one.

Vis should have been evenly distributed to absorb the shock through the entire sword, but Helmut was too focused on using swordsmanship to pay attention to that.

‘No, it’s useless.’

Helmut soon thought differently. It would have shattered eventually anyway.

The sword couldn’t withstand Helmut’s Vis.

“Grrrr.”

The creature looked down at Helmut leisurely from a distance.

As if to say, ‘What can you fight with now that you don’t even have a sword?’

In the moment the sword shattered, the creature could have delivered a fatal blow to Helmut. He had been completely defenseless, losing his weapon.

But the creature didn’t. And now, it watched Helmut’s reaction, like a cat playing with a struggling mouse.

It was a humiliating moment, but Helmut instead found solace and steadied his mind.

‘It’s being arrogant.’

He had faced stronger foes and survived countless near-death experiences in the Forest of Roots.

There would come a time to make the creature pay for its arrogance and complacency. As long as he stayed alive.

Nothing was more important than that.

Although he didn’t have the leisure to change swords, Helmut didn’t miss the chance the creature gave him and drew a sword from under his cloak.

This time it was Darien’s sword. It fit his hand incomparably better than the previous one, as if melting into his grip.

He felt he could now take on the creature. With Darien’s sword, combined with his Vis, he could deliver a fatal blow.

He was also more accustomed to wielding Darien’s swordsmanship with this sword, so his chances had improved.

‘But I might not be able to do it alone.’

It wasn’t the time to let pride get in the way. He pondered whether he should join forces with the other humans, even if they wouldn’t be much help.

At the very least, they could distract this demonic beast.

This was a kind of dilemma Helmut had never faced since entering the human world.

The opponent was strong. So strong that he could imagine himself collapsing after exhausting all his Vis if he continued to fight like this. That image was surprisingly realistic.

Even if he could defeat the creature, there was no guarantee that Helmut himself would remain unscathed.



H.F.C Chapter 250 (Part 1):

`				`Would it have been easier if he was alone? He could have withdrawn without having to fight.

Even if he defeated the beast, Helmut couldn’t trust even Charlotte.

Was it reasonable to pour everything into such a situation?

He sorely missed Alea’s presence.

But Helmut had to ensure the safety of the Grand Duke and, before that, protect Charlotte.

‘The Black Wing Knights’ Commander would be helpful.’

Eventually, people would come if the fight continued. Alonso, the Black Wing Knights’ Commander, would be the first to rush in.

In this forest, the only enemy was the demonic beast in front of him.

‘I hope the others don’t notice its true identity.’

Various magical beasts live in this world. They mostly dwell in desolate places.

The types of magical beasts differ by region. People generally only knew that magical beasts were ferocious.

Only a few mages have studied magical beasts in detail.

‘So it should be fine even if a demonic beast that can use some swordsmanship appears.’

Just when he met his mother, a beast with the Dark Seed appeared.

A human consumed by the Dark Seed. If his mother learned of its existence, how would she look at Helmut?

Helmut gritted his teeth.

Would it have been better if he hadn’t been in Renosa?

No, without him, there would be no one to deal with the beast, and more people would be in danger.

The flow had already led Helmut here, and he had to do what he could.

The monster had stopped attacking and was staring into the distant forest.

It seemed to have lost interest in Helmut, its attention captured by something else.

The beast’s eyes narrowed.

Helmut soon realized why it reacted that way.

From beyond, he could sense a faint presence running through the forest.

Though not loudly, he could feel someone moving quickly through the forest.

An adult man, probably a knight.

And the monster had keener senses than Helmut.

“Grrrr.”

A low growl escaped its throat. And in the blink of an eye—

Wham! It leapt off the ground. It had changed targets.

‘Oh no.’

It was an unfortunate situation. Helmut had hoped someone would distract the beast, but not to the extent that it would completely change direction.

Helmut could have retreated here and rejoined the main force.

But if he did, that knight would surely die.

Helmut didn’t hesitate. The dead cannot be brought back to life. If that person was someone who must not die…

Helmut immediately leaped.

Tak, tadak, tak! The beast moved through the forest, leaping from tree to tree.

Its speed was unbelievable. Blood rushed hot through its body. Its prey was right there.

The knight it had tasted earlier was quite delicious. Firm, elastic meat brimming with Vis!

It was a shame it couldn’t properly enjoy the meal due to the interruption, but it could catch a new one.

Though an interesting opponent, there was no need to waste time with him. It was enough to find easier prey!

The corners of the demonic beast’s mouth rose vertically in a vicious grin.

The knight also realized the beast’s approach. How could he not? The existence of a demonic beast rushing towards him while exuding magical energy!

It wasn’t hiding its presence at all. Under equal conditions, a human couldn’t outrun a horse.

The knight ran in terror, but not fast enough to outpace the demonic beast.

The beast, flying through the forest, swung down at the knight’s back.

Whoosh! Something flew in and collided with the hand swinging down at incredible speed. Clang!

With that sound, the knight threw himself sideways.

The beast’s hand, momentarily thwarted, struck the empty ground. Crack!

“Grrrr.”

The beast turned its head toward the direction from which the object had flown. Its eyes were filled with rage.

Helmut stood there, holding a bow. Since even Helmut couldn’t outpace the beast, he had restrained it from a distance at the right moment.

Helmut tossed aside the bow without bothering to adjust it and immediately drew his sword.

He ran straight towards the beast. He was trying to close the distance while recapturing its attention.

The beast looked at the approaching Helmut as if he were an annoyance.

Unlike the others, this one wasn’t easy.



H.F.C Chapter 250 (Part 2):

`				`As Helmut drew near, the knight who had been holding his breath watching the situation began to move.

Rustle. The small sound made the beast’s gaze return to the knight.

“Kyaaang!”

It immediately lunged towards the knight. This time Helmut was able to intercept.

Helmut, activating his whole body with Vis, approached at high speed and plunged his sword into the demonic beast’s back.

Crack! The sound of a spine breaking was heard. The beast let out a horrible scream as it turned its body. Finally, he had landed a successful blow.

Helmut managed to pull out his sword and shouted at the frozen Black Wing Knight:

“Go, now!”

He must have been one of those escorting the Grand Duke. His appearance here alone meant he was likely going to the main force to seek help.

The Grand Duke was likely still alive. For now.

If he could be quickly rescued and secured, Helmut could decide whether to continue fighting this monster or withdraw.

“Who are you…!”

Bang! Without answering, Helmut met the beast’s attack with his sword.

“Kyaaang!”

The beast, seemingly enraged at being blocked, let out a fierce roar and swung its arm at Helmut.

That slight injury didn’t seem to have much effect on it.

The clash of magical energy and Vis created a powerful wave that spread in all directions.

The shockwave lashed at the trees and wind. It was like a scene of a storm hitting.

The Black Wing Knight flinched and stood up.

Without any hesitation about whether he should fight together, he quickly realized he wouldn’t be of much help here.

That unknown boy was strong and could handle the demonic beast.

The knight determined he would only be a burden.

He had to complete his mission. To report the Grand Duke’s whereabouts.

“Hold on a little longer, I’ll bring reinforcements!”

Shouting that, the knight gritted his teeth and ran. Helmut’s arduous battle resumed.

\*

At that time, another knight who had taken a different path arrived at the main force.

Breathing a sigh of relief, he was immediately led to Charlotte and Alonso.

“Your Highness the Duchess. Knight Commander!”

“You are.”

The knight who reported on the Grand Duke’s location and current situation bowed his head. The two conversed, leaving him aside.

“Securing the Grand Duke’s safety is the priority, so it’s not wise to engage in a fight with that thing. If we send mages, they can use stealth magic to hide from the monster’s sight. We should dispatch mages. Using teleportation magic from that location to move the Grand Duke to safety would be best.”

As Black Wing Knights’ Commander Alonso suggested this, Charlotte nodded.

“That’s a good idea. Wouldn’t it be better if you went with them, Commander?”

“I must protect not only the Grand Duke but also you, Your Highness. The monster could appear here, and I can’t go there alone. Nor can we both leave this place empty. We need someone to command the troops.”

Charlotte agreed. She wanted to confirm the Grand Duke’s safety herself, but that could be done after moving him with teleportation magic.

Michael and her mother were there too.

There was one more thing Charlotte had to do now.

“I understand. But we can’t leave that monster be… It attacked the Grand Duke, killed Black Wing knights, and terrorized nearby residents.”

She knew it wouldn’t be easy to deal with such a creature.

It had killed no less than seven Black Wing knights.

But it wasn’t a situation where they could leave it alone either.

“We can’t keep such a large force away from the capital for long. Since we have a substantial force here, it would be best to eliminate the monster. But that boy called Helmut…”

Alonso furrowed his brow.

“There’s been no word of him at all. I don’t know what’s happened.”

He looked towards the misty forest and soon spoke again.

“I should go and see.”

\*

It was a grueling battle. Even though he wielded Darien’s sword, it wasn’t some legendary weapon that would suddenly make a difficult opponent easy.

Many factors were unfavorable. It was fortunate that the Dark Seed wasn’t convulsing from sensing the magical energy.

‘It seems to want to survive too.’

Or perhaps it was slowly absorbing the magical energy, enjoying a feast after a long time.

The Dark Seed, once as small as a bean, was gradually swelling in size within Helmut’s heart.

‘I wonder if they’ve reached the main force by now.’

Fighting against a strong opponent isn’t a bad thing. Helmut sometimes enjoyed it.

Even when he charged at Darien, even when he charged at Elaga.

But even Helmut didn’t want to die right away fighting an opponent who was clearly stronger and likely to defeat him.

Helmut was rational above all. Those with the Seed of Darkness cling to life. Helmut wanted to live. His battles were premised on the possibility of victory.

‘Should I retreat?’

Helmut considered it once again.

When two swordsmen of similar ability fight, the outcome is determined by the total amount of Vis.

Although Helmut had an enormous amount of Vis for his age, it wasn’t at a level comparable to a demonic beast that had bloomed the Seed of Darkness.

The beast seemed to be growing stronger.

While Helmut was gradually getting exhausted, the beast seemed fine.

He had inflicted several wounds, but they didn’t seem to have much impact.

No, he could see with his own eyes that the wounds it had received were healing.

It was reabsorbing the magical energy it had spread throughout the mountain, making the forest’s energy its own.

It was absorbing magical energy through the fight, just like practicing Vis techniques.

That magical energy greatly aided its recovery.

‘What an enviable cycle.’

At this rate, it could fight indefinitely.

As long as the forest doesn’t wither and die. A feat possible only because it was a magical beast, not a human.

In any case, Helmut had to make a decision before his Vis ran out.

Escape wouldn’t be impossible. He was confident in his ability to conceal his presence.

And soon, unexpectedly, the tide of battle changed.



H.F.C Chapter 251 (Part 1):

`				`The surroundings were filled with traces of a fierce battle.

Cratered ground, fallen trees, and crushed grass. At the center of it all was an empty clearing, as if a meteor had struck.

It was created just moments ago.

Helmut was concentrating on the battle so intensely that his head ached.

His senses had certainly narrowed. There was no time to be aware of distant places. He had to conserve his strength and deal with the enemy in front of him.

‘Luckily, I haven’t made a single mistake.’

Had he made even one mistake, he wouldn’t be standing here now. Helmut would have become the creature’s meal.

Darien never allowed Helmut a single error.

He would smack Helmut’s head and shower him with criticism at the slightest mistake.

‘You fool! Are you going to give the enemy such an opening?’

The experience he had harshly learned from Darien was proving valuable even in this prolonged battle.

“Grrrr.”

The creature’s eyes glowed. It was thoroughly enraged.

Since the Seed of Darkness bloomed, the creature had never struggled like this.

It was a predator, and even as a human it had been close to a predator’s position.

Such a beast had no patience to drag out time against what looked like a mere little rat before its eyes.

The magical energy imbued in the wooden sword suddenly intensified. The creature had decided to unleash its power.

But unleashing power creates openings.

Regardless of swordsmanship or anything else, the creature charged violently while spewing magical energy.

The branch it held in its hand had transformed due to the magical energy, taking on a monstrous shape.

Boom! Crash! Every time the creature struck the ground where Helmut had stood, the power was immense.

Helmut couldn’t dare think of counterattacking. It was like a typhoon; counterattacking would just get him swept away.

‘I need to create some distance.’

The creature’s movements had slowed slightly due to the magical energy expulsion.

Helmut, who had been matching its insanely fast attacks until now, seized the opportunity.

‘Now!’

As Helmut sharply changed direction and leaped to the side.

Swoosh- Thud!

With a sharp sound, an arrow flew like lightning and lodged in the creature’s shoulder. The demonic beast clutched its shoulder and convulsed.

“Arghhhh!”

Several more arrows directly hit the creature’s bare body.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Surprisingly, the arrows were hurting the creature!

Black smoke rose from the creature’s body, writhing in pain.

“Fall back!”

A shout came from somewhere, prompting Helmut to move. A man in black armor stood in the distance.

And around him, Black Wing Knights and soldiers were lined up, aiming their arrows. Reinforcements had arrived.

The arrows flew without pause. Helmut dodged their paths and approached them.

“So that’s the creature.”

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander muttered, frowning as he saw Helmut approach.

“You look terrible.”

It was more a frank assessment than picking a fight. The Black Wing Knights’ commander spoke down to Helmut regardless of whether he was an honored guest or not.

In fact, it was Charlotte and the other Renosa family members who had treated Helmut especially well.

Since he hadn’t allowed even a single hit, Helmut’s condition was relatively intact.

But he couldn’t completely escape the shockwaves of the attacks, so his hair was a mess and his clothes were torn in several places.

Helmut coldly retorted:

“You sure took your time getting here.”

A battle of this scale should have been felt even from a distance, yet they moved sluggishly.

“We were able to locate the monster thanks to the knight you spared.”

His tone suggested praise, as if saying “well done.” Helmut glanced briefly towards the demonic beast.

It was crawling on the ground, being hit by the rain of arrows.

Smoke rose from its body as if it were burning. The creature must be feeling pain like being burned at the stake.

‘So the arrows are effective.’

For Helmut, who couldn’t even wound the creature with arrows imbued with Vis, it was a bit of a blow to his pride.

But those arrows weren’t effective against the beast for no reason. They must be no ordinary arrows.

Alonso explained:

“These are purification arrows made by the temple. They’re for hunting great magical beasts, kept in the treasure vault. I didn’t think we’d have a chance to use them.”

It seemed they hadn’t come unprepared for the subjugation. They had their own reliable means, and it was proving very effective.

The power of sacred energy was indeed remarkable, even in small quantities, against entities possessing magical energy.

Holy power was the natural enemy of magical energy. What couldn’t be achieved with vast amounts of Vis was being accomplished.



H.F.C Chapter 251 (Part 2):

`				`A brief, rapid exchange followed.

“That sword too?”

“It’s been imbued with holy power.”

Alonso had already drawn his sword. Helmut asked the most important question:

“The Grand Duke?”

“You should say ‘His Highness the Grand Duke.’ He’s safe. Since the monster is here.”

“Charlotte.”

“Her Highness the Duchess is safely positioned in the rear. You seem worried about your junior.”

“Not really.”

There was a sense of protective wariness in Alonso’s gaze, like an uncle wary of someone eyeing his beloved niece.

The suspicion that Helmut might like Charlotte was now tedious.

Hundreds of arrows were raining down. The soldiers kept firing without pause, as if intending to turn the beast to dust by exhausting all their arrows.

The demonic beast now lay sprawled, being hit by arrows without even making a sound. It seemed to be using all its magical energy to regenerate its body.

“What about the signal flare?”

“There was no time to take it out.”

There hadn’t even been a moment to fumble for the signal flare. He had been busy restraining and facing the creature.

First, deal with the annoying mosquito buzzing in front of you. The creature’s sole focus seemed to be attacking Helmut.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander spoke while keeping his gaze on the beast:

“I can see that you’re strong, but acting alone isn’t necessarily wise. Keep that in mind.”

“Then prove that you can be of help.”

An arrogant reply struck down. Helmut gave the Black Wing Knights’ Commander a cold stare.

This surely wasn’t the end. The creature’s magical energy was like an eternally burning flame.

Even holy power hadn’t damaged its core.

The Seed of Darkness. The blossomed dark seed was an infinite source of power.

Until it was completely destroyed, it could be restrained but not stopped entirely.

And then the rain of arrows ceased.

Although they had brought a considerable number of arrows, even the wealthy Renosa family didn’t have an unlimited supply of purification arrows.

Until this incident occurred, they had been free from attacks by magical beasts.

“It’s not moving.”

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander raised his hand. All the knights and soldiers stood alert, awaiting his instructions.

The monster was quiet. As if its breath had been cut off just like that.

The black smoke rising from the creature’s body persisted. And the arrows densely lodged in its body as well.

There was no point in forming an encirclement – it could easily break through.

For that reason, the troops were positioned in one place.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander slowly stepped forward. The sword in his hand, imbued with holy power, emitted a sharp light.

He intended to pierce the creature’s vital point with it. Undoubtedly that was his plan.

Helmut followed about a step behind. Someone of the Black Wing Knights’ Commander’s caliber should be able to deal with the creature’s attacks sufficiently.

However, when they had closed the distance somewhat, the creature’s body twitched.

Its body rose up as if lifted into the air.

A sudden eruption of magical energy from within. In an instant, the arrows densely lodged in its body melted away.

Ssshh!

Like a volcano ejecting steam, black smoke explosively gushed out in an instant. It was smoke carrying magical energy.

An enormous amount of smoke obscured the entire view like a fog, turning everything pitch black.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander and Helmut quickly held their breath and raised their Vis.

Even with their sight obscured, their senses were keen and alert.

The creature could attack taking advantage of the obscured view. Their nerves were taut with tension.

They stood still in place, waiting for the smoke to clear. As the wind blew and time passed, the smoke gradually dispersed.

And when their vision cleared, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“It’s gone?”

“Where on earth did it go…?”

The place where the creature had been was empty. No one had been attacked.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander muttered:

“Did it escape?”

It had been hit by purification arrows and depleted its magical energy. In that state, with the number of enemies increasing as well. It would make sense to retreat if it felt disadvantaged.

Even an intelligent magical beast might do so, let alone the creature which had been human. It should have that much intelligence.

But Helmut didn’t agree with Alonso’s speculation.

Something felt off. An ominous premonition was rising. There was something they were missing.

Suddenly, his heart plummeted. In an instant, the blood in his fingertips went cold. He shuddered.

It was a sensation very similar to fear.

The moment a certain thought occurred to him, Helmut cried out involuntarily. His tone was uncharacteristically agitated:

“Charlotte!”

While fighting the creature, he had suspected it might possess some rationality. Since it could wield swordsmanship, it might be able to think somewhat like a human.

What if it had heard what Helmut said?

What if it had realized that Charlotte was Helmut’s weakness…

It was a mistake. Why had he asked where she was?

Helmut himself did not fear death.

Dying in battle was something a swordsman could always face. It was also the fate of one born with the Seed of Darkness to overcome.

Of course, Helmut desired battles he could win, and he had confidence in creating such battles.

But even so, he did not forget the fact that he was close to death. He had the courage to accept that.

But what if that death wasn’t his?

That was what he feared. A moment later, Helmut shouted again:

“Where’s Charlotte!”

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander gestured in a direction. His expression was also frozen.

Helmut’s feet struck the ground. No thoughts came to mind. He just ran with all his might in the direction where Charlotte was.

There was no time to worry about conserving Vis or not.

Charlotte must not die. He couldn’t let her die.

She was more than just a junior who admired and recognized him well.

She was his sister.

A blood relative he hadn’t even known existed.

She was his mother’s daughter.

He couldn’t let her die. Absolutely not.



H.F.C Chapter 252 (Part 1):

`				`The beast was running. Crushing and trampling the twigs and leaves that blocked its path.

It seemed to be running on the ground at the speed of a bird flying through the sky.

Its body, exuding black demonic energy like smoke, was red like newly formed flesh, but without a single wound.

Just moments ago, the holy power of the purification arrows had burned through its skin and seared the flesh beneath.

That pain, like being branded with a red-hot iron! The demonic energy had protected the beast’s heart, preventing a fatal wound, but it couldn’t shield it from the agony.

“Grrrr.”

The beast’s eyes rolled back.

Its murderous intent and rage amplified the demonic energy.

It wouldn’t be satisfied until it killed all the humans here and crunched their bones and flesh between its teeth.

That fierce hostility stimulated the Seed of Darkness.

The blooming Seed of Darkness was powerful, and the creature, having not suffered a fatal wound, was able to endure that brief yet intense pain.

Though the arrow’s wound didn’t leave a mark, the extreme resentment was deeply etched into the demonic beast.

It would kill them all!

However, the number of humans was great, and quite a few were formidable.

No matter how powerful the creature was, having the Seed of Darkness, it couldn’t face so many humans after being hit by the purification arrows.

But it couldn’t retreat just like this.

The image of the black-haired human boy flashed through its mind.

Despicable wretch!

It had been a one-on-one duel. The beast would have been the victor in that fight. That’s how it would have ended if given time.

But then the other humans ambushed it?

No matter. They would all pay for it!

A few words exchanged from a distance.

The fool had foolishly revealed his weakness, and even as the beast’s entire body burned from the purification arrows, it didn’t miss their conversation and movements.

Charlotte.

The demonic beast instinctively realized that was the human woman’s name.

The moment the rain of arrows ceased, the beast knew its time had come.

Spewing out demonic energy to obscure vision, the beast immediately sprang into action, searching for the owner of that name.

In the direction pointed out by the other human!

How could a mere human woman possibly withstand the demonic beast’s attack?

The boy would arrive too late, only to wail over the woman’s bisected corpse.

Hissss. The beast ran, emitting demonic energy.

The scenery before its eyes changed in an instant. Not even a four-legged beast could outrun this beast at this point.

The grass withered and died black wherever it passed. It climbed trees, leaped over soldiers, and rushed towards its target beyond.

Soon, the creature found her. A human girl standing with a worried expression, surrounded by soldiers.

Realizing immediately that this was ‘Charlotte’. The only woman there. Didn’t she resemble that boy closely?

The beast’s pupils dilated. A satisfied look.

Someone spotted the creature and shouted.

“It’s a demonic beast!”

“The demonic beast is coming this way!”

“Protect Her Highness the Duchess!”

To think the creature would appear here! Had the main force accompanying the Black Wing Knights’ Commander been completely annihilated?

Fear and despair clouded everyone’s faces. But all the soldiers here were elites.

There were none who tried to flee. Seeing these ephemeral beings raising their weapons, a sneer crossed the beast’s lips.

Thwack! With a light swing of the beast’s arm, soldiers were sent flying like sheets of paper.

Weapons didn’t even pierce its body. With each swing of its arm, one head was crushed, one torso pierced through.

Blood and flesh splattered. It was a crucible of terror.

The demonic beast roared in front of Charlotte.

“Raaaargh!”

Worthless and weak humans. Even those of Renosa’s noble bloodline were no different.

When it was human, even the strongest couldn’t escape the chains of social status.

But now, the beast could turn even those who had been far above it into mere livestock. Livestock to be slaughtered!

They would all meet the same fate.

Yet surprisingly, the young human woman before its eyes was staring at the beast with clear eyes.

Irritated by the human woman’s attitude, the beast licked its lips threateningly.

Charlotte couldn’t remain calm.

‘To think it came this far.’

She felt a tension as if all the blood in her body had frozen.

If Helmut and her master Alonso had fallen, Charlotte would not be able to escape death here unless a miracle occurred.

The demonic beast was vicious and strong. It was terrifying. How could one not be afraid?

However, what was even more frightening was to die trembling without doing anything.

Charlotte certainly did not take up the sword for that. That was the pride of Renosa. To fight in a manner befitting the Renosa bloodline.

Charlotte quietly watched the creature’s movements with her sword drawn.

With a concentration that wouldn’t miss even the rustling of a leaf. She knew this wasn’t an opponent she could defeat by attacking.

That’s why she waited. In the fighting style she was familiar with.

‘Counterattack.’

She had already experienced the fastest movements.

She had fought Helmut. Even Helmut couldn’t take her down in one strike.

The beast might be stronger than Helmut, but it couldn’t be faster than him.

And then the creature moved.



H.F.C Chapter 252 (Part 2):

`				`Momentarily tilting its head at Charlotte’s unusual reaction.

The beast had to finish her off and escape before the enemies realized its target and gave chase.

The beast’s blood-stained hand stretched out as fast as lightning.

Clang! The sword deflected the beast’s strike. Despite deflecting the attack, an immense shock spread throughout Charlotte’s body.

The demonic energy emanating from it was suffocating.

Charlotte instinctively threw herself to the side.

Boom! A hole appeared where she had been standing, as if dug with a shovel.

Seeing the black shadow looming over her, Charlotte reflexively raised her sword.

All the Vis she possessed gathered in her sword.

But it was useless.

Crack!

The sword in her hand shattered, and a massive hand struck her abdomen like a hammer.

Thud! Charlotte fell helplessly and rolled on the ground. She couldn’t even feel the pain. All strength drained from her body.

“Charlotte!”

Someone called out her name loudly. It was a familiar voice.

Charlotte looked in that direction with blurry eyes.

“I’m… oka…”

She lost consciousness before finishing her words. Blood soaked her abdomen.

‘I’m too late.’

Helmut stood protectively in front of Charlotte.

The creature smirked, licking the blood on its hand. As if saying, in the end, you lost.

A faint breathing sound could be heard from behind. Charlotte wasn’t dead yet. She could survive if treated quickly.

But this beast wouldn’t allow that to happen.

‘In that case…’

His heart was burning. A certain power surged from the very center of his heart, as if about to explode.

He would give it his all.

The moment that thought struck his mind, Helmut realized he hadn’t been giving his all.

Because the Seed of Darkness was part of his full strength. He always had to keep the Seed of Darkness in check.

But now, for the first time, it escaped his consciousness. The lock inside him was released.

Vis erupted from Helmut’s sword. It was a darker, ashen Vis than before.

Drawing on the power of the Seed of Darkness was frighteningly natural. Like a fish knowing how to swim.

Now it was a battle of instincts. He unleashes Darien’s swordsmanship with full power.

As his consciousness numbed, Helmut charged at the creature.

Bang, crash, boom!

Debris flew everywhere, and dust billowed.

It was no longer a human battle. But it was certainly different from before.

What defeats demonic energy is ultimately stronger demonic energy!

The beast’s demonic energy, weakened by holy power, no longer surpassed Helmut’s.

When the two clashed head-on,

Bang! With a tremendous noise, the beast’s body stiffened from the impact.

Seizing that moment, someone’s sword came flying in from behind.

The sword of Alonso, the Black Wing Knights’ Commander!

That sword, precisely targeting its back, sent sacred energy coursing through the beast’s blood vessels.

“Grrrr!”

Its body had already taken damage. The demonic energy wrapped around it like armor dispersed.

At that very moment, Helmut’s ashen sword pierced the beast’s heart.

Thud!

With a dull sound, black blood spurted. The beast’s movements ceased.

Helmut vividly felt what he had pierced.

The blooming Seed of Darkness.

That which had blossomed vibrantly even after being hit by purification arrows now shattered like glass.

Black demonic energy spread around like miasma flowing from a corpse.

Alonso quickly retreated from the creature. Helmut also stepped back, leaving his sword in place.

Thump. The beast, its heart pierced, fell to its knees.

The strength rapidly drained from its body, only its upper body remaining upright.

At that moment, the consciousness that had been dominated by the Seed of Darkness regained control for just an instant.

The beast’s eyes blinked. Focus returned to both eyes. That gaze fixed on Helmut. It was a piercing look, befitting a Platinum-rank mercenary.

“You too will eventually…”

Along with a sneer, the monster uttered a curse. Helmut seemed to understand the words it couldn’t finish.

‘Become like me!’

A moment later, the focus disappeared from the monster’s eyes. Its lifeless head drooped.

It was over.

The bloomed dark seed had perished, and the monster met its death like a stone statue.

Thud. Helmut collapsed to his knees. His palms hit the ground.

He could barely feel the rough texture of the soil, as if his senses were numb.

His heart ached as if about to burst. He felt dizzy.

The price of borrowing the forbidden power of the Seed of Darkness, due to his own lack of strength, was now crashing down on him.

Not even once had he considered that power as his own. Even in the moment it saved his life.

He had thought himself strong. That was true. Helmut had never met anyone this strong in the human world before.

But today, he met an enemy that made him realize his arrogance. Helmut felt painfully weak. He wasn’t strong enough yet.

Look at this state.

“Are you alright?” Alonso asked.

Helmut managed to ask in a strained voice.

“Is Charlotte… alive?”

“The soldiers gave her emergency treatment and moved her while you were fighting that thing. But you….”

A shallow sense of relief washed over him. He couldn’t hear what Alonso was saying. It seemed he had exhausted his stamina to the limit.

His consciousness was fading. Normally, Helmut would never lose consciousness in front of someone else.

But it couldn’t be helped.

Helmut collapsed completely.



H.F.C Chapter 253 (Part 1):

`				`Never in history had Renosa been pushed into such a crisis.

Seven Black Wing Knights were dead. And the Grand Duke and his daughter the Duchess were severely injured.

Fortunately, the most important people of the Renosa family did not die, and the situation seemed to be resolved without incident.

However, at that time, an unwelcome guest visited Ratona.

In preparation for any emergencies, a message had been sent to the temple.

The temple is always looking for opportunities to expand its influence.

That’s why even the imperial family, which is already somewhat influenced by the temple, doesn’t rashly seek the temple’s help.

Renosa’s affairs are handled by Renosa. That was the principle.

However, with such a powerful magical beast, there might be variables. If the newly dispatched forces were to be annihilated as well, then…

Therefore, Renosa naturally contacted the temple.

But no one expected that the two High Priests, who were originally supposed to visit Renosa but had disappeared without a trace, would immediately come to Ratona.

The one who greeted them was Margret, the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Because she was the only one in a position to greet the High Priests.

“It’s been a very long time, Your Grace the Grand Duchess.”

It was known to the public that the High Priests of the temple were arrogant people who placed nothing above the gods, looking down even on royalty.

However, these two were among the more moderate of the High Priests.

But even if they were considered moderate, they were still High Priests.

Those who believed that divine rules were superior to human laws.

They could do anything. As long as it was the rule of the gods.

Although the Grand Duchess of Renosa had grown up with deep faith since childhood, she couldn’t wholly welcome them.

After all, she had clearly seen what they were capable of 15 years ago.

Margret calmly greeted them.

“High Priest Agato, High Priest Levina. Thank you for visiting us. Renosa will not forget the help you’ve provided in treating His Grace the Grand Duke and our Charlotte with your noble hands.”

The pair of High Priests, a man and a woman, both exuded a young and sacred aura, looking young enough to be considered youths. They had an appearance befitting High Priests.

Especially High Priest Levina, who exuded a gentle yet noble dignity that would suit being called a saint.

“I’m glad we could be of help. We were originally supposed to visit Ratona for the swordsmanship tournament, weren’t we?”

“Our schedule was disrupted, but we didn’t expect the cause of that disruption to be here in Renosa. We were completely off track.”

High Priest Agato clicked his tongue. Margret looked at him.

“Does that mean the temple also knew about the existence of that demonic beast? I heard it was a truly powerful and unheard-of vicious beast. You must have heard about the damage we suffered.”

“Yes, we heard that seven Black Wing Knights and several dozen soldiers died. That’s relatively minor damage. The beast killed a priest and a holy knight as soon as it awakened and fled. Its whereabouts have been unknown since then, and we’ve been chasing it, but we didn’t expect it to flow into Renosa along the mountain range. Indeed, intelligent ones are difficult.”

One word that Agato uttered caught Margret’s attention.

“What do you mean by awakening?”

High Priest Levina explained in a gentle voice.

“The beast is a human with the Seed of Darkness. It managed to grow while evading the temple’s eyes and awakened early. Being a former mercenary, it’s skilled at moving without leaving traces, which made tracking difficult.”

The seed of darkness. Those words made Margret’s usually composed face stiffen.

High Priest Levina didn’t find her agitation strange.

Because she was one of the people from the temple who had been here in Renosa 15 years ago.

“It seems to bring back unpleasant memories.”

“…A little, yes.”

“You must be very tired, Your Grace, having to protect Ratona alone during this series of events.”

High Priest Levina’s transparent green eyes met Margret’s blue ones. It was a gaze that seemed to pierce through the heart.

Her heart chilled. How could that be possible?

No, the other party was a High Priest. Nothing would be strange no matter what they could do.

Margret answered with a ladylike smile, hiding her agitation.

“There was a moment of crisis, but fortunately it was resolved safely. You both must be tired from rushing here, why don’t you rest in your quarters first?”

“That would be good.”

High Priest Agato left first. However, High Priest Levina, who was about to follow him, hesitated.

She exchanged a glance with Agato and returned to the room to face Margret.

“Do you have any remaining business with me?”

High Priest Levina wore an ambiguous smile. It was an unreadable expression.

“I forgot to mention one thing.”

“What is it?”

“About that boy. The remarkable swordsman who faced the demonic beast. A black-haired boy, I hear? Strangely, they say he resembles His Grace the Grand Duke very much.”

Where did she hear that from? Margret’s heart sank.

Margret calmly met High Priest Levina’s eyes. A light flashed in Levina’s green eyes. Whether it was curiosity or hostility, it was unclear.

“I heard he was injured. Would it be alright if I examined the boy?”

After a moment, Margret’s lips parted.

\*



H.F.C Chapter 253 (Part 2):

`				`It seems there was some exaggeration. After all, it was the Black Wing Knights’ Commander Alonso who faced the demonic beast.

The boy is merely a commoner, so it wouldn’t be appropriate for a High Priest to meet him.

He’s a former mercenary, and although he’s not injured, he’s currently resting after depleting his Vis. He’s sensitive, so we don’t know what rudeness he might commit. It would be better to meet him a few days later.

Margret naturally deflected Levina’s request with many excuses she made up in an instant.

It was true that the situation wasn’t appropriate for Levina to meet Helmut. After all, he was unconscious.

Levina didn’t bother to dig into Margret’s excuses.

‘Then a few days later would be good.’

Leaving only those words, Levina left, and immediately after, Margret summoned another person.

Black Wing Knights’ Commander Alonso. Although she had received a brief report on the situation, Margret was also confused by the news of the High Priests’ arrival.

In her haste to prepare to receive them, she hadn’t had the chance to inquire about what exactly happened in the forest.

Now it was time to hear that story.

Shortly after, Black Wing Knights’ Commander Alonso entered the room.

“How are you feeling?”

Alonso opened his mouth with a cautious expression.

“I’m fine as I wasn’t injured. It’s just that I couldn’t protect Her Highness the Duchess… I apologize.”

“It couldn’t be helped. And Charlotte is now… safe.”

Concern and relief simultaneously flashed across Margret’s face. Before Margret could ask, Alonso spoke first.

“I can guess why you called me. That boy.”

“Yes. Please report.”

Margret cared for Helmut. He was her child, brought back from the dead. How could she not be attached to him when it wasn’t her wish to abandon him?

But she couldn’t ignore what he might be.

A child who survived the Forest of Roots. Margret knew well how extraordinary that was.

Before the expedition, Margret had asked Black Wing Knights’ Commander Alonso to observe Helmut and tell her about him.

Alonso remembered Margret’s instructions.

“I saw him fight. He was a boy too strong for his age. So strong that it was unbelievable. So strong that even I, the Black Wing Knights’ Commander, couldn’t stand against him. Powerful Vis, precise and fast swordsmanship. It’s not ordinary for that to be the skill of a mere fifteen-year-old boy.”

“Do you mean… it can’t be explained by the word ‘genius’?”

“Yes, that’s right. That talent doesn’t belong to the human category. Above all, when that boy faced the magical beast, I felt it.”

“Felt what?”

“From the body of that boy named Helmut, I felt magical energy. Just like what I felt from that magical beast! A human using magical energy…”

Margret’s complexion turned pale. She hastily rebutted.

“Could it be a misunderstanding? I heard that the whole area was steeped in magical energy. Perhaps…”

“Your Grace, I am the Black Wing Knights’ Commander. I am not mistaken.”

Alonso said firmly. Margret looked at him blankly.

Alonso doesn’t know about what happened 15 years ago. Only a very few know about that incident.

Alonso has been the Black Wing Knights’ Commander for 11 years.

So Alonso is simply speaking based on his own judgment, without any prejudice.

That Helmut used magical energy, and that he is a dangerous existence.

“When that boy collapsed, I struggled with whether I should cut him down. The reason I didn’t was because he was worried about Her Highness the Duchess.”

“I see…”

Margret lowered her head. It wasn’t Alonso’s place to judge her strange reaction. He shook his head and said.

“Although he has no evil intentions, his very existence is dangerous. If he can’t be eliminated, he should be sent away. This is my judgment about that boy.”

With that, Alonso concluded his words.

Margret remained silent for a moment, her gaze lowered. She only opened her mouth again after a while.

“I understand your opinion. You may go now.”

\*

Shortly after Alonso left, another guest sought out Margret. This time, it was a guest Margret hadn’t summoned.

Margret had been sitting still, lost in thought, ever since Alonso left the room.

It was only when she heard the news of Michael’s visit that Margret raised her head.

“Mother.”

“Michael, what brings you here?”

Unlike his usual self, Michael wore a face without a smile.

“I have something to tell you, Mother.”

“…Go ahead.”

“I had a brother. A brother one year older than me. Born with the name Helmut, disappeared without even his existence being known.”

Margret’s pupils shook at this sudden truth. Michael saw her reaction clearly. And he was certain. That what he was saying was the truth!

“In reality, a cursed child born with the Seed of Darkness and sent to the Forest of Roots.”

Michael continued speaking in a calm manner.

“And he survived that place where no one was supposed to return alive, and came back to this Ratona.”

Margret immediately sprang to her feet.

“Who else knows this?”

Looking at the pale-faced Margret, Michael quietly shook his head.

“It hasn’t leaked out yet. Not even to the High Priests. But they will find out. They have eyes and ears, after all. Besides, aren’t they quite perceptive in such matters?”

Michael still wore a face without a hint of a smile. He continued speaking in his characteristically calm and affectionate tone.

“I have only one thing to say to you. You are the Grand Duchess of Renosa, aren’t you?”

Michael’s blue eyes were cold. Although they were similar in color to Margret’s, they were colder than hers.

However, the essence of the two was not different. They were mother and son, after all.

Margret with her gentle and affectionate gaze. However, Margret was a woman who could make colder decisions than Michael even with that gaze.

She was a born noble and the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Michael’s declaration pierced her like a cold sword.

“Make a decision for Renosa.”

And then Michael finally smiled his characteristic innocent smile across his face.

“As always, I will respect and follow your choice, Mother. Whatever that choice may be.”



H.F.C Chapter 254 (Part 1):

`				`‘A decision for Renosa.’

Margret, born and raised as a noble.

Had there ever been a time when those words, which she had followed without difficulty except for once, felt so heavy?

After Michael’s visit, Margret, who had been lost in thought for a while, opened her eyes that had been heavily closed.

She could guess how Michael had found out about that fact.

In the Grand Duke’s study, there was a journal recording significant events happening in Renosa. It was a journal that the Grand Duke personally wrote in.

With the Grand Duke absent now, it was Michael who had control over Renosa.

It wouldn’t have been difficult for Michael to extract information from there.

Michael only needed to find the record of that day 15 years ago.

“…I.”

Margret let out a sigh.

She knew it too. If Michael had figured it out, the High Priests could figure it out as well.

If Levina showed interest in Helmut again, how long could Margret hold them back with excuses?

Michael could reveal that fact to the High Priests at any time.

Although he had received treatment from the High Priest, the Grand Duke was still in a weakened state. He had not yet regained consciousness.

In this situation, it was impossible to confront the temple.

That wasn’t a choice for the Grand Duchess of Renosa to make.

But she too was human. A weak and wavering human.

Margret’s worries deepened.

It seemed she wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight.

\*

When he opened his eyes, what he saw was a familiar ceiling.

This air, it’s familiar.

Helmut blinked. It seemed they had brought him back to his previous quarters intact.

Everything was quiet.

“Hmm.”

Helmut, who was about to get up immediately, frowned.

His whole body felt stiff and weak. As if he had been drained to the bottom and just recovered enough to open his eyes.

It had been a long time since he had been pushed to his limits like this.

But he was in much better condition than when he had just left the Forest of Roots.

‘It seems the situation has been resolved safely.’

He had been gripped by anxiety as he lost consciousness in a place where he had no one to trust.

But seeing that he had been moved to his quarters like this, there must have been no problem. It was enough that he was alive.

Helmut examined his own condition. He looked into himself as if observing.

The Seed of Darkness had grown again. The series of processes of using and expelling demonic energy was enough to make the seed of darkness grow.

But what bothered him was that the seed, which always wriggled like a fetus in a womb, was oddly quiet. As if it were in hibernation.

Perhaps it too had struggled to survive.

Helmut stopped pondering and suddenly looked down at his arm. There was someone who came to mind first.

‘Is Alea still…?’

His girlfriend probably didn’t even know that Helmut had nearly died.

Well, even she wouldn’t have expected that Helmut, who had been fine, would face a life-threatening crisis. It happened in too short a time.

‘What on earth is she doing?’

He didn’t feel like blaming her anew. Alea was that kind of girl. A research-addicted mage.

‘No, I do want to blame her.’

Helmut changed his mind. But it was also true that he couldn’t think of any other suitable words to blame Alea.

Because his body wasn’t moving properly, Helmut only raised his upper body and sat with his back against the wall.

How long had it been since he had let go of his sword? He wanted to head to the training ground right away if he could.

His clothes had been changed into clean ones. Only his cloak and sword were nowhere to be seen.

Click. Soon, the door opened and then closed, followed by the sound of footsteps running somewhere.

After a while, there was a knock, and someone entered the room.

Just by hearing the footsteps, Helmut recognized who it was. Helmut immediately raised his gaze.

“Mother.”

Blue eyes full of worry were staring at him. It was a face that had visibly thinned in just a few days.

But her expression as she looked at Helmut was calm and affectionate. Really like that of a mother.

“Don’t get up. The physician said that your bones and muscles were all damaged due to the clash of vis. As your recovery seems to be good, I didn’t call for a healing mage separately.”

“How long has it been?”

“Three days, dear.”

‘I wasn’t unconscious for as long as I thought.’

Short, but his instincts must have judged that it was time to wake up from unconsciousness.

Helmut brought up another question.

“Charlotte?”

“She’s fine. She’s being treated. People from the temple just arrived. Thanks to that, she’s passed the critical point and there’s no danger to her life. It will take some time to recover, but they say she’ll be as healthy as if nothing had happened.”

“People from the temple…?”

Helmut instinctively examined his mother’s expression. His wariness peaked.

His mother shook her head.

“They didn’t see you.”

That seemed to be true. Helmut relaxed his nerves only then.

Even with Alea’s bracelet, an unconscious Helmut couldn’t completely control the faint demonic energy his body emitted.

If a priest had seen Helmut, they wouldn’t have tried to keep him alive. Also, no matter how unconscious he was, Helmut couldn’t have failed to sense the holy power manifesting nearby.

His mother tightly grasped his hand.

“I’m really grateful to you.”

With those words, everything felt enough.

Helmut learned the joy of his strength being used for someone else after coming to the human world.

When he saved Alea, and right at this moment.

What he learned in the human world were the things one could feel as a human, not alone.

For this, he left the Forest of Roots. It was something worth more than could be explained in any words.

At that moment, suddenly, Margret’s touch became stronger.

“Mother?”



H.F.C Chapter 254 (Part 2):

`				`Margret murmured with her head bowed.

“I’m grateful, and I’m sorry. I only gave birth to you, I haven’t done anything for you.”

Helmut weakly shook his head.

She called his name, and became the purpose of his life. She allowed him to return here.

So Helmut gained a lot. It might not be said that he received much, but it wasn’t that there was nothing.

“It’s alright.”

“Take care of yourself for a while. The temple people might rummage around the palace, so it would be good to move you to a place that helps with Vis recovery soon.”

“My sword…”

There was no situation that stimulated Helmut’s wariness as much as being empty-handed, without a weapon.

Above all, that sword was Darien’s keepsake. He didn’t want it to catch anyone else’s eyes.

Though not many people would recognize it.

‘There’s also Michael.’

His mother whispered gently.

“Alonso has taken care of it. It will be moved there first along with your belongings, so you just focus on recovering. I know you’re eager to train, but you need to rest for now.”

Helmut nodded.

“Yes.”

People from the temple. He didn’t know who came, but they would probably be focused on the recovery of the Grand Duke and Duchess. Their attention wouldn’t reach this far.

Even if they’re curious about the swordsman who defeated the demonic beast, his mother will take care of it well.

This is Renosa Palace, so it was right to follow the words of his mother, the Grand Duchess.

Soon his mother left, and a light meal to restore his strength was brought in.

Helmut focused on recovery for several days.

The next day he could stand up from the bed, and the day after that he could walk a little.

Even so, he couldn’t go beyond the vicinity of the room.

There was still no contact from Alea. It seems her research hasn’t ended yet.

His mother visited him every day, and when he could walk, she said it would be good to move locations.

“After midnight, in the early morning.”

Helmut nodded.

\*

He had a strange feeling. As if a foggy wind was stirring and blowing.

His senses became keen. A dawn that felt like something was about to happen.

Outside was pitch black. The place they arrived after moving by carriage with his mother was the Renosa Grand Ducal villa near Ratona.

The faintly lit villa was quiet. There was a sense of presence inside the villa mansion, but it was faint.

In Helmut’s current physical state, it was impossible to detect presences perfectly.

‘Is it the Black Wing Knights?’

His mother smiled and urged. It was still a calm and gentle smile.

It felt somewhat different from usual, but it was probably because of the tension from moving secretly late at night.

“Let’s go inside.”

Helmut followed her inside.

His mother naturally led Helmut to a certain place in the villa garden.

While saying there was a training ground good for recovering Vis.

It was a sturdy dome-shaped building. A strange sensation held back his steps. It felt somewhat chilly.

However, his mother was still smiling. As if to ease Helmut’s wariness, she went in first.

And she reached out her hand towards Helmut.

“Come on. Your sword and belongings have all been moved here.”

Helmut couldn’t refuse her words.

As he entered, it was dark before his eyes. Somehow, strength left his body. The door closed behind him. Clank.

Helmut, who had taken a few steps into the dark entrance, suddenly stopped.

He stared at the scene before him as if frozen.

Unlike the entrance, the inside was spacious and bright.

However, that place didn’t look like a training ground at all. Cracks all over the floor. Like a magic circle. His sword was nowhere to be found.

The ominous premonition becomes reality. A chilling sensation piercing him vertically. A dull noise shakes his insides.

Helmut calmly called her.

“Mother.”

Margret, who was walking ahead, quietly turned to look at him.

In her eyes reflecting Helmut’s expressionless face, there was sadness.

No, it had been there from the start. Helmut just hadn’t noticed.

“I’m sorry.”

Grateful, and sorry. Helmut finally seemed to understand which of those words his mother had really wanted to say.

‘I’m sorry.’

For making the same choice again.

Helmut gritted his teeth. The shadow of fate was looming.

A gentle voice echoed from somewhere.

“Well done, Your Highness the Grand Duchess. Now, please step back.”

The clothes of the two people walking out from the other side were dazzling.

Massive holy power could be felt from them wearing pure white clothes.

As their holy power seeped in, light spread through the cracks on the floor. It soon turned into a single magic circle.

“The preparations are complete.”

Helmut realized what kind of place this was. He could tell at a glance.

That this was the very place where he had been sent to the Forest of Roots15 years ago, on that day.

It wasn’t a dramatic betrayal.

His mother had only lured Helmut here by using his trust in her.

It’s not that there were no signs, nor that he didn’t feel anything.

Still, he wanted to believe.

That desire to believe blinded Helmut’s eyes.

Now Helmut had to pay the price for lowering his guard and trusting someone, despite having the Seed of Darkness. A terribly painful price.

Margret didn’t move. She was right beside him, looking at Helmut.

Tears overflowed from her gentle blue eyes.

“Helmut.”

That voice calling his name was as sorrowful and plaintive as on that day 15 years ago.

Who could doubt her sincerity?

But she was a woman who could make choices that betrayed her true feelings. That was the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Even if he had no strength, it would take just a moment to reach out and break her neck.

However, Helmut stood still like a stone, only facing her.

His mother had prepared for the consequences of this betrayal. That’s why she was giving Helmut a chance.

A chance to kill her, to punish the mother who had abandoned her child twice!

Helmut let that chance pass as if he had never wished for it.

It was an irresistible force.

Although Helmut could take someone’s life without hesitation, he too had feelings he couldn’t help.

Feelings that stemmed from the beginning.

Helmut could never, ever abandon that.

Even if his mother had betrayed him.

Someone led his mother away. Helmut was left alone on the glowing sacred magic circle.

Two High Priests surrounded him. Anyway, he had neither the strength nor the sword to resist. He had fallen completely into the trap. Foolishly.

The voices of the two people echoed like a reverberation.

“O pitiful one, born with noble blood but not granted a fate befitting it.”

“One with the Seed of Darkness will surely become a calamity. Therefore…”

Soon, a bright light poured down towards Helmut. It was a light like a sun burning his body.

“May you return to the place you came from and sleep.”

Helmut closed his eyes. As powerful holy power enveloped his entire body, a burning sensation as if scorching his skin swept over him.



H.F.C Chapter 255 (Part 1):

`				`It was over. Everything.

The air of Forest of Roots, filled with acrid demonic energy, was oddly comforting to him.

He had lived in the human world for about a year. Yet this air was more familiar.

Helmut fully realized that he had returned.

The process of returning was incomparably simpler than the process of leaving.

The sacred magic cast by the High Priests was an absolute force against those who possessed demonic energy.

Should he be grateful that it didn’t kill him right away?

“Where is this place?”

He must have fallen somewhere random in the Forest of Roots. Whose territory would it be? Now, must he live here again?

Helmut thought calmly. But at that moment, his vision turned pitch black.

Something inside seemed to snap. A terrible emotion rushed in. The thread of reason he had been barely holding onto was easily let go.

Despair, it swallowed Helmut whole.

His heart churned, and his insides turned. Soon, an intense pain swept over him.

A pain as if grinding all his muscles and blood vessels at once!

His body bent backward and floated in the air on its own. As if in a vacuum.

It felt like a huge hole had been punctured in his heart. A hole sucking everything in! An enormous gravitational pull.

His heart, no, the Seed of Darkness, frantically absorbed the demonic energy around it, as if it were water.

The demonic energy in the Forest of Roots rapidly surged into Helmut.

Helmut’s Vis was in a state of minimal recovery, and the demonic energy filled his emptied body to overflowing. A process like dying and being reborn.

Despair handed everything over to the Seed of Darkness. While undergoing this process, consciousness sank, and Helmut’s body was perfectly deprived of control for the first time.

After a while, everything around became quiet. Has a section of the Forest of Roots ever had its demonic energy so diluted?

Helmut, who had been floating in the air, gently settled on the ground.

The moment he raised his head, Helmut’s pupils greatly dilated.

“Grrrr.”

There wasn’t a significant change. But the only thing living in those eyes was a ferocious instinct.

To kill and destroy everything alive.

Helmut began to move.

\*

Elaga was lounging around as usual. It had been enjoying freedom for over a year.

The freedom to laze about comfortably! The annoying guy who always kept it in check was dead, and the one who had caused him the agony of childcare had disappeared.

Although it felt a bit empty because of that, Elaga had found a good substitute that required less effort.

Unlike the habit of monsters to kill and dominate, Elaga had taken a liking to caring for someone else.

‘It’s comfortable and nice.’

Next to Elaga, stretched out long and enjoying the sunbath, sat a small girl who looked about eight years old.

The girl with a bright face was sitting close to Elaga, showing no signs of fear.

The girl had even made a large flower crown and placed it on Elaga’s head.

The flowers were colorful and non-toxic, a rarity in the Forest of Roots.

‘Hmm?’

Suddenly, Elaga felt something. The ground trembled. A massive wave as if the forest was collapsing.

Something was moving over there. Just like a typhoon was blowing.

[What is this wave?]

Elaga got up. The flower crown fell off its head. The girl made a sad face.

“Eek, Lord Elaga?”

[Be quiet. This is not the time. You quickly go inside there. I need to go somewhere.]

Elaga swiftly scooped up the girl with its tail and pushed her into a nearby house, closing the door. A woman peeked her head out of the window from inside.

“Lord Elaga?”

[Don’t come out of the house until I return.]

“Yes.”

Elaga ran as if flying. The giant leopard sprinted through the forest with surprising agility.

The place where the wave was felt was close to its territory. Curiosity arose about what was happening there.

After a short while, Elaga arrived at the spot and frowned.

‘Hm? It’s completely devastated.’

It was eerily quiet. As if death had passed through. Trees broken and crushed, and the corpses of beasts cut into pieces.

Quite a strong one.

And over there, a human figure brimming with demonic energy was visible. Its movement stopped precisely when Elaga appeared.

‘A human?’

Elaga took a bold step towards it without tension.

There were few beings in the Forest of Roots that could make Elaga tense. Let alone if the opponent was human.

The figure’s appearance came clearly into view from within the cast shadow.

[Helmut?]

Elaga’s pupils enlarged. Elaga easily recognized the opponent.

It’s the one it had raised, wrapping and turning in its embrace since childhood. Although he had grown a bit and his scent had changed, there was no way it wouldn’t recognize him.

But the joy of recognition was short-lived; something was off.

The other didn’t seem to recognize Elaga. He just stared at Elaga warily with fierce eyes full of killing intent.

The reason Helmut didn’t immediately charge was not because he recognized Elaga, but because his instinct sensed that Elaga was very strong.



H.F.C Chapter 255 (Part 2):

`				`Elaga squinted its eyes.

[What’s with this guy? Suddenly appearing.]

His eyes look crazed, his condition doesn’t seem good at all. The demonic energy wafting from his body is not ordinary either. A semi-monsterfied state.

But to Elaga, who was a monster, Helmut’s monsterfied state was nothing special.

Elaga nonchalantly tapped the ground with its tail.

[What happened? No, more importantly, why are you here? I heard you were doing well outside.]

There was no answer. It was incomprehensible why this guy had suddenly appeared in the Forest of Roots.

Elaga approached Helmut step by step. Even if his mind had gone haywire, maybe if he rolled him around with his front paws like before, he would spill everything on his own.

But Helmut was no longer his former self.

Helmut’s instinct was impulsive. Feeling threatened by the approaching leopard with terrifying demonic energy, Helmut immediately turned aggressive.

Just as he had done to other beasts until now, he would tear apart the enemy. As if it were an absolute proposition.

However, Elaga easily deflected the charging Helmut with its tail. Thwack!

[What are you doing? Want to fight?]

Elaga stared at Helmut, who had fallen askew.

Killing intent flashed in Helmut’s eyes. He charged at Elaga again, as if broken. Quite powerful demonic energy erupted from his entire body.

‘Is this a challenge?’

Elaga snorted.

Elaga had never lost to Helmut. It was even less likely to lose to someone who was raging without even being in his right mind.

Because there was no one stronger than Elaga, who had even swallowed Naho’s core, in this Forest of Roots.

Thwack, thwack, thwack! Helmut’s attempts were repeatedly blocked.

Annoyed, Elaga struck Helmut down and stepped on him with its front paw.

[Where did you leave that fancy sword or whatever, to recklessly charge at me barehanded and expect to win?]

Elaga spoke with a tone of disbelief.

Human weapons do not lie in their flesh. How could that fragile body pierce through Elaga’s demonic energy and wound it?

However, Helmut didn’t seem to be listening. Despite being subdued, he bit at Elaga’s fur with his blunt teeth and convulsed.

“Graaargh!”

No matter how wildly he thrashed, he was just a small human.

Elaga sighed while pinning down Helmut with its front paw.

‘This won’t do.’

Elaga began to absorb Helmut’s demonic energy while keeping him pinned.

In the Forest of Roots, rich with demonic energy, it’s rare for beasts to show madness. It’s a comfortable environment, like fish living in water.

The Seed of Darkness was similar in nature to beasts. Whatever had stimulated it this much, it wouldn’t have lasted long normally.

But Helmut was human, so it was unclear how things would turn out.

This seemed more like a case of demonic energy intoxication. If so, the solution was to drain the demonic energy.

The Seed of Darkness surprisingly complied with Elaga’s intent, recognizing him as a stronger presence. It didn’t resist.

Helmut’s body was quickly drained, leaving only a bit of Vis.

It wasn’t long before Helmut regained his senses. His chest felt heavy, as if a stone was placed on it.

He frowned and looked up at the giant leopard pinning him down.

“Ela…ga?”

[Yes, what are you doing here?]

The moment the situation was recognized, Helmut’s breath caught.

‘What did I…’

He didn’t want to answer. There was nothing to answer.

Elaga’s questions continued.

[Did you find what you wanted outside?]

“Yeah.”

[Then why are you in this state?]

Helmut glared at Elaga. It was a cold gaze.

“Leave me alone.”

[What are you saying? After I helped you. Fine, I’ll leave you alone.]

Offended, Elaga left Helmut and abruptly departed from that place. Somehow, it felt like that’s what he should do.

Helmut was left alone. Lying there. He muttered dryly to himself.

‘Elaga is still the same.’

It was probably watching him from over there.

As if his heart was empty, he felt no emotion.

Helmut lay on the ground and looked up at the sky. The sky that was now surrounded by pitch-black darkness.

His whole body felt powerless. He had let the Seed of Darkness take over his body and ravaged through the Forest of Roots.

Whether it was good luck or bad, he hadn’t encountered any dangerous enemies. Even destroying himself wasn’t easy for Helmut.

Once again, Elaga had saved him.

‘Elaga is just a demonic beast, and yet…’

The beast had given him more affection than his own flesh and blood.

A surge of emotion welled up from a corner of his heart.

Memories flashed through his mind. Memories that were sweet for a moment, and terribly painful.

The affection he felt from his mother wasn’t a lie. She was genuinely happy that Helmut had returned.

But humans could abandon even if they loved.

They could betray even if they loved.

They could turn their backs even if they cared.

Helmut didn’t know humans could do that.

He had only believed in affection. Because those he knew had not betrayed affection.

It was bitter, but he learned a lot.

The pain of that learning was so great that Helmut never wanted to leave this forest again.

When Helmut was in the Forest of Roots, he had nothing, but he wasn’t lonely.

A life driven by longing couldn’t be lonely. If he could see the stars above and hope to reach them one day.

Even when exhausted from grueling training, that aspiration led and filled him.

But how was it when he went outside the Forest of Roots?

Helmut gained many things but in the end, returned to where he started. Having lost even what he had.

Betrayal? No. What Helmut experienced was loss. A loss that seemed irretrievable by anything.

There was still a glimmer of light flickering before his eyes. In that light, like a strand of moonlight, someone’s figure is reflected.

But if even that light goes out, then.

An enormous void swallows him. The burning heat felt like it was scorching his heart.

Something inside him had crumbled, and it seemed irreparable.

Helmut covered his eyes with his hands. They were hot.



H.F.C Chapter 256 (Part 1):

`				`A few days had passed, just like any other. The guests who had visited Renosa had already left.

It was a peaceful afternoon with the warm sunlight streaming down. The Grand Duchess of Renosa, Margret, gently closed and opened her eyes.

A cool breeze flowed in through the window. A teacup sat before her. It was just like any other day.

As if no hardship or sorrow had ever swept over her.

She hadn’t forgotten yet. But she didn’t regret it either.

Yes, she had no regrets. Just as she hadn’t fifteen years ago.

A child once abandoned could be abandoned twice. Why would it be impossible? She hadn’t regretted it back then either.

Helmut was already a child she considered dead. Family is formed by sharing life together, not just by blood.

Thus, Helmut was her child but not her family.

Before it came to that, Margret was forced to make a choice. Every circumstance forced that choice upon her.

Even so, the choice was hers to make.

Margret abandoned Helmut once again, and she would not forget that fact.

She would continue to live bearing another grave within her. As the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

She was prepared to bear that weight.

The seemingly fragile Margret was, in fact, a cold and strong woman. The noble life she had lived made her so.

Thud! The sound of a door opening was heard. Someone roughly pushed the door open and entered.

“Your Highness, the Duchess!”

The voice of the head maid called out in surprise.

Margret raised her head. There stood Charlotte with an expression she had never seen before.

Her two eyes were hot with passion. Those eyes were strongly condemning Margret.

“Do you know what you’ve done, Mother?”

It was a voice brimming with emotion. It was the first time Charlotte had spoken like this.

Margret lightly raised her hand, dismissing the head maid. Clunk. The door closed again.

Only then did Margret calmly open her mouth.

“It was unavoidable.”

Her expression remained terrifyingly gentle and calm. Like a lake without a single ripple.

“How could a person…!”

Charlotte’s voice was choked with reproach because, no matter what reason was given, it was unacceptable to her.

“Mother, you are the Grand Duchess, but before that, you are a mother and a human!”

A moment ago, when she heard the truth from Michael, it was like being struck by lightning.

Only then did it make sense. The inexplicable attraction. It wasn’t as a man. but as a blood relative.

Charlotte liked Helmut, respected him, and followed him.

That Helmut was betrayed in exchange for saving her.

It was betrayal. A betrayal Charlotte could not accept!

Margret quietly responded.

“It was a choice for Renosa.”

Charlotte spoke in a suppressed voice.

“How can that be, Mother? Senior Helmut saved the Grand Duke… and saved me.”

“Yes, he did.”

That’s why Helmut was spared from being executed by the High Priests.

The High Priests calmly accepted when Margret told the truth. As if they had already guessed.

High Priest Levina’s insight was not to be underestimated. As soon as she heard Helmut’s name, she recalled that ‘Helmut’ from fifteen years ago.

Levina didn’t rule out the possibility of that child surviving and escaping from the Forest of Roots, an unlikely event.

Levina was determined to confirm it, even without Margret’s permission. So it was bound to happen anyway.

Margret explained that fifteen years ago, Helmut had fallen on the outskirts of the Forest of Roots, and as a newborn, he had accidentally come out of the barrier and was saved.

She said that now that the Seed of Darkness had grown, he wouldn’t be able to leave the barrier.

Also, since he had performed a great service in saving the Grand Duke and Duchess, it would be unacceptable to kill him when he was currently without crime.

Therefore, she proposed sending him back to the Forest of Roots, from which he could not escape this time.

Margret presented the minimum point of agreement to persuade them without confronting the temple.

The High Priests agreed. It was unprecedented for someone to escape from the Forest of Roots. Whatever principle allowed it to happen, they believed it wouldn’t happen twice.

Moreover, they were burdened by the idea of eliminating Renosa’s bloodline against the Grand Duchess’ will.

They had already fallen out with Basor. It was unthinkable to turn Renosa against them as well.

Margret spoke in a clear voice. The same words as before flowed out a little longer.

“But for the sake of Renosa, and for your sake, I had to do it.”

There were more than enough reasons to abandon Helmut. Because he was dangerous for having the Seed of Darkness, or for fear of falling out with the temple. Those two reasons were sufficient, but there was one more.

The awakened Seed of Darkness bearer had killed seven members of the Black Wing Knights. He was too strong, and without Helmut, they might not have been able to stop him.

In other words, it was Helmut who stopped him. Because Helmut was that strong.

A certain unease sprouted within Margret.

Helmut was too strong. So strong that even the Commander of the Black Wing Knights couldn’t do anything.

What if he coveted the position of heir to the Grand Duke, which he should have rightfully held?

What if he tried to eliminate his two siblings, especially Michael?

No one would be able to stop him.

Even a mother is human, and it’s impossible to love all children equally.

They say all ten fingers hurt when bitten, but some fingers hurt more than others.

Margret had spent her life caring for Michael. Michael was weak and could have died at any time. It was a miracle that he survived.

How could she not love such a child?

Love for a living child must be greater than for a dead one.

Michael would not want to give up his position as heir to the Grand Duke to anyone, and in that process, he would undoubtedly fall out with Helmut, just as he had with Charlotte.

If Helmut tried to eliminate Michael then.



H.F.C Chapter 256 (Part 2):

`				`The Seed of Darkness is said to awaken malice and evil in people.

Helmut didn’t seem dangerous. But what if Margret’s eyes were wrong?

She couldn’t take that risk. She had two children, the Grand Duke, and Renosa to protect.

She had too much to lose, so she couldn’t exist solely as Helmut’s mother.

Helmut was too dangerous and uncontrollable. She couldn’t leave him be. Even if he left or ran away, what if he changed his mind and came back?

The only thing she could do as a mother was to die by his hands.

Just as Margret was the Grand Duchess of Renosa, Charlotte was the Grand Princess of Renosa.

And so, she caught the things Margret didn’t say in her stern gaze.

But the words coming out of her mouth were still the same.

“…You were wrong, Mother. You shouldn’t have done that.”

“I had to.”

“I simply cannot understand.”

“You’re that kind of child. I know.”

Margret nodded slowly. Firmness emanated from her.

Tears flowed from Charlotte’s eyes. The sense of guilt was hers, not her ruthless family’s.

But Charlotte was not one to simply weep in guilt. Her life, her sword, her beliefs.

Charlotte had not grown up to be a weak girl.

A storm of betrayal, guilt, and sympathy passed through her.

And in the calm Charlotte, a resolution was formed. This resolution would now become her everything.

A determined light settled in Charlotte’s eyes.

She declared.

“I will set things right.”

Margret looked at her with incomprehensible eyes.

“What has been done, even if it cannot be undone, can still be corrected.”

“Even if it harms Renosa?”

“Yes, because unlike you, Mother, I want to be human before being the Duchess of Renosa.”

She had been saved. They were blood relatives. Living with guilt and gratitude was not enough.

Charlotte didn’t want to live bearing a grave.

She had to repay that debt to the person concerned. Without fail.

“Charlotte.”

Margret’s face contorted for the first time. A soft voice, as if pleading, as if coaxing.

In the past, she would have wavered at her mother’s voice and gaze. But not anymore.

“It’s no use trying to stop me.”

Charlotte turned her back and left the place.

Helmut would be alive in the Forest of Roots. She believed.

That belief would guide Charlotte to him.

\*

Everything happened in just a few days. In the few days when contact with Helmut was cut off.

It wasn’t that Alea wanted it to be that way. The problem started when she heard those words from Heike.

“The temple’s movements? Well, it seems the High Priests are busy because some priests were killed.”

Heike shrugged.

“The priests were killed? Who did it?”

“I don’t know. Ah, but have you taken over Lampione’s dungeon yet?”

“Not yet.”

“There should be ‘that thing’ left in Lampione’s dungeon. It would be very useful in a fight against the temple.”

At Heike’s words, Alea immediately explored the dungeon and found ‘the thing’.

It seemed that mastering ‘the thing’ would require quite a tricky process. It would take at least a few days.

But if there was a conflict with the temple, ‘the thing’ would be a great force.

Alea calculated and concluded. She thought that even if contact was cut off for those few days, nothing serious would happen to Helmut.

After focusing without even sleeping, Alea succeeded in mastering ‘it’ and felt ecstatic.

Only then did she realize quite some time had passed and thought of her forgotten boyfriend.

Wanting to tell Helmut this news first, she immediately tried to contact him.

However, her artifact didn’t work. No signal at all.

As if… he didn’t exist in this world.

Her blood ran cold.

Alea immediately realized something was wrong and headed to Renosa.

In Ratona, Helmut’s existence was already nowhere to be found. Everything was clean and peaceful as if wiped clean.

Over several days, Alea explored the entire Ratona with Heike’s help and read the memories of the earth.

In the process, Alea learned that the High Priests had visited Ratona.

This could not be a mere coincidence.

If Helmut had disappeared, that event must be absolutely related to the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Alea tracked the Grand Duchess’s whereabouts and finally found where Helmut had last disappeared.

The Grand Duke’s Mansion. Alea, who had infiltrated there, realized the identity of the holy magic performed there.

“Teleportation magic.”

An absolute punishment. Banishment to the Forest of Roots.

Helmut was sent to the place he had spent his lifetime escaping from. For him, with the Seed of Darkness, he cannot cross the sacred barrier.

It felt like a death sentence had been passed. What she thought would be a brief separation had torn them apart forever.

Why had she been so obsessed with the dungeon? Not knowing what situation he was in.

Regret and despair swept over Alea. She could almost see how Helmut must be feeling, even without seeing him.

She couldn’t be by his side at the most important moment.

But soon she raised her head straight.

‘No, I can bring him back. I’ll make it happen.’

Alea didn’t blame herself. She was a mage. Mages are beings who make the impossible possible.

Helmut is strong and familiar with the Forest of Roots. There’s also the leopard that took care of him.

Helmut must be alive. As long as he’s alive, Alea can go find him.

And she will cross the sacred barrier and liberate Helmut from there.

Alea clearly told Heike.

“I’m going to the Forest of Roots.”

To go and meet Helmut.

A clear light rose in Alea’s amethyst-like eyes.

She would bring Helmut back, and also make those who sent him back to the Forest of Roots pay the price someday.



H.F.C Chapter 257 (Part 1): From the Bottom

`				`It took quite a long time to get back up again.

Falling from the cliff to the bottom, everything about Helmut was shattered.

Looking up from the broken state, all that could be seen was the cliff. There must be a sky above it, but that sky was ashen. Who would want to climb towards an ashen sky?

Despair breeds lethargy. Helmut was deep in lethargy.

A fire without firewood can no longer blaze. It seemed like all that remained for him was ashes.

His once vivid and intense eyes lost their light, and his expressionless face was clouded with emptiness.

After pouring out all his emotions, he felt nothing, as if he had become empty. No pain, no hatred, no anguish.

‘Maybe I’ve decided not to feel.’

Emptiness devours life. He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what meaning there would be in doing anything.

Just a monster living and breathing as it is.

Because he didn’t want such a life, because he wanted to be human, he left this place, but in the end, he was back where he started.

‘Just like this…’

He didn’t want to do anything. Immersed in the emptiness that deeply filled his lungs, what Helmut chose was silence and sleep.

He spent the day listlessly lying in place, not knowing how it passed.

That day became two days, then three days, and flowed on like water.

A completely different life from when he lived in the Forest of Roots before.

The previous Helmut didn’t waste even a single day, but the Helmut then and now were different.

Helmut had grown, but the driving force that made him grow was gone.

Helmut abandoned even the training ingrained in his body and lived like a corpse.

Lying on the ground, quietly gazing at the sky.

The abundant magical energy in the Forest of Roots quickly restored his body, and the Seed of Darkness slowly regained its momentum.

Though not as fiercely as before, it exerted enough influence over Helmut.

While his body recovered, the recovery of his mind was slower.

What truly moves humans is, in fact, the mind. So Helmut was in a state no different from being fatally wounded.

Helmut’s lethargy was in a realm incomprehensible to some.

For the first time in his life, the white leopard looked with displeasure at Helmut, who was being lazier than when he was a newborn.

‘Well, I was glad to see him return.’

But the joy of reunion was brief. In Elaga’s eyes, Helmut’s state was utterly incomprehensible.

The guy who rarely cried even as a newborn was suddenly whining, which was strange, so it left him alone, but it was getting worse.

For a weak human, Helmut hadn’t eaten or drunk anything for days.

The past of swinging the sword like mad was long gone, and the sight of him lying like dead was somehow unpleasant to see. A slight sense of urgency arose.

‘He shouldn’t starve to death.’

Whether he had the Seed of Darkness or had grown stronger, in Elaga’s eyes, Helmut was still a miserably weak and young human.

And taking care of Helmut so he doesn’t die is something Elaga is used to.

It still couldn’t shake the habit of looking after something. It was this habit that made it look after other humans as well.

Frustratingly, Elaga, following its old habits, shoved food at Helmut and scolded:

[How long are you going to stay like this? Eat this!]

What Elaga thrust at Helmut was meat. Now that there was a cook to prepare its prey nicely, it was jerky with seasoning.

However, Helmut didn’t even glance at it.

Elaga scolded again.

[Those who don’t hunt don’t deserve to eat, but I’m giving this to you as a special treat since you’ve returned. Eat it now!]

“I don’t need it.”

As the brief refusal fell, a fierce growl leaked from the massive white leopard.

[Grrrrrr.]

Elaga did not tolerate Helmut rejecting its goodwill.

[Should I shove it down your throat?]

A cold light flashed in Elaga’s eyes. It was literal sincerity.

The Forest of Roots is a world of survival of the fittest. The weak must obey the strong.

Helmut realized in a strange way that he had indeed returned.

‘How annoying.’

In the outside world, Helmut had never met a human stronger than himself. He had only been outnumbered.

This situation of being newly placed in a weak position stimulated Helmut’s dulled senses.

‘It’s bothersome.’

But what could he do? Elaga was strong and could carry out its threats. And Helmut didn’t even have his sword.

Helmut forcibly chewed and swallowed the jerky.

Elaga watched Helmut eat the jerky with a gaze too fierce to be called motherly. And only after the meal was finished did it leave.

Elaga didn’t sit around all day to torment Helmut, but

this was repeated daily. Of course, not for long.



H.F.C Chapter 257 (Part 2): From the Bottom

`				`Elaga was never a considerate or understanding creature to begin with, and why Helmut was acting like this wasn’t an important issue to it.

It was only important that in Elaga’s eyes, Helmut appeared to be lazy, and that was unpleasant to see.

Before long, Elaga, whose patience had reached its limit, shouted.

[How long are you going to live on what I bring you to eat! You useless creature!]

But Helmut didn’t respond. Amidst the pouring scolding, Helmut lay still as if he had blocked his ears.

Finally, Elaga frowned and asked.

[What exactly happened outside? Did your mother abandon you again, saying she doesn’t need a cursed child?]

Helmut’s body twitched slightly at that question.

Only then did Elaga realize.

[So that’s what happened. I thought something was off about your state.]

I sent you off to the human world, only for you to return betrayed. After a moment, Elaga bluntly said.

[Stupid fool.]

Those words were purely criticism, not at all meant as comfort. To Elaga, the one who gets beaten is at fault. Of course, it wasn’t like that when it was the one getting beaten.

[So how long are you going to live uselessly like this? Are you trying to die?]

With a flick of its tail, Helmut muttered dryly.

“Leave me alone.”

For the first time, some emotion showed on his face. It was irritation. But that irritation was soon covered again by emptiness.

He reacted to stimuli, but the reaction was quickly buried.

Elaga persisted and asked.

[If I leave you alone, how long will you stay like this?]

“…”

Instead of giving an open-ended answer, Helmut chose silence, and ironically, Elaga read hope in his silence.

The fact that Helmut hadn’t completely given up on everything.

‘His will to live isn’t completely extinguished.’

Desire makes humans live on. What Helmut needs now is to want something again.

‘He’s strong for a human, so he’ll get back up someday.’

Elaga could guarantee that much.

Isn’t Helmut the first non-human to survive in this Forest of Roots and reach the outside world?

But until that ‘someday’ arrived, Elaga couldn’t just leave him alone.

Elaga was a demonic beast lacking in empathy, and even if Helmut had been abandoned by his parents yesterday, he would still mistreat him today and have plenty left over. For someone like that, it had been very patient.

‘I guess I have to help him.’

It would have been more like Elaga to beat him into submission.

But even Elaga had a soft spot for Helmut.

Elaga decided to help Helmut in a more moderate way.

Beasts live busy lives eating, drinking, and hunting. Helmut should rightfully live such a life too.

Especially since Elaga was a diligent beast. Wasn’t it taking care of new things now that Helmut had left and it had become free?

‘She might be of help.’

As soon as that thought occurred to it, Elaga went to find her.

[Susan.]

When it called from outside the house, a woman showed her face by opening the window.

“Yes, Elaga!”

The woman who answered briskly had neatly tied brown hair and a pretty face.

An attractive human woman in her late 20s. To look that way even in the Forest of Roots where there’s no need to dress up or groom oneself, she must have been considered quite a beauty in the outside world.

Susan was a noble. As nobles often do, she got caught up in a power struggle and was thrown into the Forest of Roots with her young daughter after losing her husband.

She was lucky. It’s a far-fetched thing for a human woman with no power, be it sword or magic, to survive in the Forest of Roots, but she met Erugo and survived.

And the luckier part is that Erugo died not long after she fell into his hands. Along with the owner of the human farm where she was.

There were dangerous moments. As soon as Naho died, the monsters lurking near his territory bared their teeth greedily towards the fragile humans. It was on a whole different level than the previous offensives.

The injured Erugo could do nothing.

Thinking that beasts would no longer run wild now that Naho had awakened, he stepped out of the lab and was immediately caught alive by sharp teeth.

Other humans followed a similar course. Without Naho and Erugo, they were powerless, and the attacking beasts were strong enough to break down the walls of the houses where the humans were hiding.

When Elaga absorbed Naho’s core and immediately found the human farm, everything was almost over.

All those humans were completely devoured by the greedy beasts without leaving even corpses.

Susan was holding her daughter tightly and holding her breath in Erugo’s lab.

Luckily escaping to Erugo’s lab whose door was open, she managed to survive there for days with only a small amount of water and food.

Erugo’s lab, the most solid hiding place, was the only one that didn’t collapse under the beasts’ offensive.

They were the only survivors. The reason Susan and Sarah survived was that while she was escaping with her daughter, others became sacrifices.

Elaga found their location by smell. They were terrified when Elaga spoke to them from outside the lab.

[Hey, humans in there. How are you doing?]

A beast intelligent enough to communicate with humans. Unlike the vicious Naho, they quickly opened up to Elaga, a beautiful white leopard.

In fact, Susan and Sarah had no choice but to rely on Elaga’s mercy.

There was no point in just holding out in the lab; once the food ran out, it would be over anyway.

“We, we’re okay.”

[So only you two survived.]

Elaga clicked its tongue. If it didn’t take care of these two, they would be eaten by demonic beasts like the other humans.

Without hesitation, Elaga took these two humans under its wing.

For some reason, it felt natural to Elaga.

Just as it had protected and raised Helmut, Elaga would do the same for them. It was Elaga’s hobby and habit.

‘I’ve raised a male, now it’s females.’

And the latter was certainly more enjoyable to raise.

While Helmut was an unlovable and arrogant fellow, Susan and Sarah were cute and gentle.

Above all, these two trusted and followed Elaga.

Seeing Susan and Sarah rushing out of the house to greet him whenever he brought back prey, Elaga felt like he had become a head of household.

It was a novel experience.

‘Wounds inflicted by humans should be healed by humans.’

Elaga thought simply. And it said to Susan, who was looking at it with eyes full of trust.

[You have a job to do.]



H.F.C Chapter 258 (Part 1):

`				`The surroundings were desolate and quiet. An unusual peace had settled in this part of the Forest of Roots.

No beast in the area was unaware that Helmut was under Elaga’s protection. Therefore, he wouldn’t be attacked.

For Helmut, it was a familiar day, but that day was different. As Elaga approached lazily, Helmut sensed a faint presence beside it.

Helmut turned his head. Two humans stood next to Elaga. One was a woman, the other a small girl.

Elaga spoke triumphantly.

[Now, why don’t you humans have a chat with each other?]

“Um, hello?”

“He… llo?”

[That guy’s name is Helmut. The bigger one is Susan, the smaller one is Sarah.]

Helmut quietly observed the woman and girl who cautiously greeted him.

There was only one reason he reacted. This was the Forest of Roots. It wasn’t an environment where the fragile humans before him could survive. He could guess who they were.

‘Naho’s… livestock, perhaps.’

The young girl, Sarah, ran up to Helmut and asked,

“I’m Sarah. Why is Helmut lying in a place like that?”

‘Is this Elaga’s new hobby?’

It seems it’s taken an interest in caring for humans after grumbling about it. Helmut’s interest ended there.

After withdrawing his gaze from them, Helmut closed his eyes again.

Black hair and black eyes. Although incomparably more delicate compared to the demonic beasts in the Forest of Roots, Helmut somehow exuded an intimidating aura. A boy with a dry and cold atmosphere.

Although they had heard Elaga raised him, there was no sense of familiarity. It’s difficult for a boy raised in the Forest of Roots to be ordinary.

The woman hesitated, unable to speak. Sarah, less perceptive than her, bravely thrust her face towards Helmut.

Elaga had given permission to bother Helmut as much as they wanted, disregarding the subject’s wishes.

“Helmut, doesn’t your back hurt lying like that?”

“Helmut, where did you come from? Where were you born?”

“Helmut, Helmut, Helmut!”

Helmut couldn’t help but react to her incessant chattering.

“Don’t bother me.”

Though brief, his words were abruptly cutting, with a hint of ferocity.

The girl flinched, her face immediately contorting. And then,

“Waaahh!”

A piercing cry tore through their eardrums.

Helmut raised his Vis to block out the sound.

To think that the first time he used Vis after all this was for something like this.

‘Elaga.’

It’s doing unnecessary things. He had told it to leave him alone. It never respects his wishes.

Of course, Elaga had its reasons. Elaga was an insensitive leopard and the ruler of this domain. And Elaga still acted as if it were Helmut’s guardian.

“Sa-Sarah. Don’t cry.”

Susan hugged her daughter to comfort her. Elaga frowned, looking alternately at Sarah and Helmut, then spoke gruffly.

[Making a child cry, what a temper.]

That wasn’t something anyone could deny, but Elaga wasn’t exactly in a position to say it.

Sarah soon stopped crying. But she didn’t leave Susan’s arms, staying tightly embraced. It wasn’t at all an atmosphere for conversation.

Elaga, dissatisfied, tapped the ground with its tail and gently pushed them with it.

[We’ll come back tomorrow.]

Helmut didn’t answer. His answer wouldn’t have mattered anyway.

The problem was that Elaga really kept its word.

The next day, it brought the two human females to visit Helmut again.

This time, they came with a basket full of food that Susan had personally cooked.

There was even bread, somehow baked with ingredients they had obtained. It’s food that’s hard to come by in the Forest of Roots.

However, Helmut didn’t show any reaction to the food that was emitting a delicious aroma.

Helmut had tasted all sorts of delicacies from the outside world. Also, while some fill the emptiness in their hearts by filling their stomachs, Helmut was the opposite.

This time too, Helmut only chewed and swallowed the food perfunctorily after being threatened by Elaga that it would force it down his throat if he didn’t eat.

“Um, how does it taste?”

Susan asked cautiously.

She was of noble origin. The boy before her seemed far younger in comparison.

But there was a feeling that she couldn’t treat him carelessly, which naturally made her speech more polite.

Helmut didn’t respond this time either. He chewed and swallowed the food perfunctorily, then lay back down.

These unfamiliar women, the existence of humans, irritated him like insects crawling on his skin, but he chose not to react.

“Helmut, hello!”

Children are simple. Sarah, her mood recovered in just a day, tried to speak to him again, but Helmut ignored her.

This time, Sarah didn’t cry. Susan and Sarah spent time there, chattering with each other, regardless of Helmut’s silence.

They passed the time doing needlework they had brought or reading books from who knows where. As if Helmut was just a background to them.

Elaga occasionally conversed with them, staying there for hours before taking them away.

This continued. Not every day, but quite frequently, about every other day.

And at some point, their visits became unbearably irritating to Helmut.

They weren’t constantly talking to him, but just their presence, moving around and making noise next to him.

It invaded the time Helmut desired.

What Helmut wanted was just silence. A swamp-like silence where no one existed. He wanted to be immersed in that. He needed no one.

But the voices he could hear even without listening, their movements, their existence. He tried to ignore it, but even the act of trying to ignore it was irritating, and at some point, it became unbearable.

Helmut finally called out to Elaga when it came to visit him alone a few days later.



H.F.C Chapter 258 (Part 2):

`				`“Elaga.”

[Have you finally decided to get up?]

Elaga raised its head proudly, as if it knew this would happen. A cold voice flowed from Helmut.

“Don’t you think I might harm them?”

Elaga snorted derisively.

[Don’t be ridiculous, you weakling. As long as I’m watching with both eyes wide open, you can’t do that.]

It was Elaga who was being ridiculous. No matter how easily it subdued his rampages, Elaga couldn’t prevent him from breaking the neck of a woman right in front of him.

‘Does Elaga think I won’t do that?’

Elaga couldn’t guess how much Helmut might have changed in the human world.

Was that confidence born from a beast’s instinct? The one who knew best that Elaga’s confidence was right was Helmut himself.

No matter how broken he was, no matter how immersed in emptiness and despair, Helmut was still Helmut.

Helmut doesn’t do such things.

Absolutely not.

They say humans have a rock bottom, but Helmut’s rock bottom didn’t reach the point of harming the weak out of frustration.

It was his nature. An unadulterated essence that couldn’t be twisted or degenerated.

Helmut realized that he hadn’t shattered.

Like an unbroken bead among fallen fragments.

He just needed time now. He didn’t know how much he needed, but.

Elaga casually threw a question.

[What do you think? Those two women.]

“What do I think?”

Helmut asked coldly. One might be considered a woman, but the other was too young to be called a woman.

[Which one do you like more?]

Helmut doubted his ears for a moment. The nuance of the question sounded strange.

“Which one do I like more?”

[Yeah, I’ve been thinking. It might be a bit early, but you’re almost of age in human years. It’s time for you to find a mate. That might make you feel better.]

Elaga thought that the wound from his mother could be healed by creating a new family.

Its intention in bringing Susan and Sarah wasn’t simply for them to befriend Helmut.

Elaga was presenting them to Helmut. it didn’t consider their wishes. After all, Helmut was a cute and strong human male.

It didn’t think of them as livestock, but unlike the independent Helmut, the two women were completely dependent on Elaga. They were as good as Elaga’s possessions.

Elaga threw out, as if doing him a favor.

[Choose whichever one you like. The younger one will need some time to grow, but there’d be less of an age gap than with Susan.]

Helmut unknowingly shouted fiercely.

“Elaga, are you out of your mind?”

Curses and condemnations filled his throat.

[Watch your language. I’m saying this all for your sake. What’s the problem?]

“You don’t know what the problem is?”

His chest felt tight. Right, Elaga, being a beast, might not understand.

But really, bringing a mother and daughter and telling him to choose one of them. It was unacceptable from the perspective of human common sense and ethics.

Even for Helmut, who was dull to such things, hearing Elaga’s words made him feel not just frustrated, but angry.

It was stimulating Helmut in some way.

[Having a mate, bonding, having children, it’ll make your life here more bearable. That’s what humans say.]

“You’re wrong. That’s not me. And not them.”

Helmut cut off decisively. He had never been this resolute in his life.

Elaga tilted its head, genuinely curious.

[Why not? Have you met women outside?]

“I have.”

[Was she pretty?]

It seemed that even a monster’s eyes could discern human beauty.

Helmut frowned. A memory he didn’t want to remember, one he had forcibly buried within himself, faintly surfaced.

A girl with silver hair and purple eyes.

“She was beautiful.”

Elaga spoke with a pitiful tone.

[But you’re in the Forest of Roots now, and you can’t meet her anymore, right? That woman might stab you in the back like your mother, too.]

“I know.”

Helmut spat out coldly. At this point, it was questionable whether Elaga was deliberately digging into his wounds.

Was it telling him to despair even more, since he was already in despair?

[Was she really that beautiful? Is that why these don’t catch your eye?]

“Yes. So why don’t you find a mate, Elaga?”

Whether it was a leopard or some other beast, as long as it was its kind. Why not choose one among beasts instead of treating them like livestock?

Was it trying to build a farm without even eating humans? Telling him to mate with any woman and have offspring, was truly a beast’s sentiment.

In any case, Helmut had no intention of complying. His family had betrayed him, and his heart had been trampled.

Even Darien’s sword had been taken from him, and all that remained was himself. Helmut was sick of both humans and emotions.

‘Feeling this way, I guess I’ve become quite human-like.’

Helmut suddenly realized how much he had changed in the human world.

[If you really don’t want to, then don’t. But since you’re all humans, try to get along.]

Elaga turned its back after speaking as it pleased, inwardly grumbling about how picky he was.

Only after he was alone again did his surging emotions subside.

He thought there was no heat left in him, but strangely, those stimuli from Elaga broke through Helmut’s lethargy.

It shook the core of his sunken self.

That shaking, faster than expected, made Helmut stand up.

About two months after returning to the Forest of Roots and spending time meaninglessly, Helmut picked up his sword again.



H.F.C Chapter 259 (Part 1):

`				`Whoosh―

A powerful resonance fills the space. Precise and flawless movements.

There wasn’t a single instructor who didn’t admire his sword practice.

Swordsmanship that slices through the wind, dividing the air. Yet those movements were extremely natural.

It was swordsmanship perfectly ingrained in his body after years of harsh training.

Even though there had been a recent gap in those years, long-established habits didn’t disappear.

Helmut was inherently like rock or iron. As his essence was such, once something was engraved, it didn’t change easily.

However, regardless of how it appeared, Helmut felt a subtle discomfort.

‘It’s awkward somehow.’

A body that had been perfectly trained. Attempting intense movements after a long time, it feels stiff and rusty somewhere.

Vis has a property of trying to preserve the body in its best condition.

Even if it had stiffened, it wouldn’t return to a softer state worse than that of an average person.

But even so, a body that hadn’t moved for two months couldn’t be in its best condition.

However, Helmut knew what to do. He swung his sword, forgetting the flow of time.

Until heat circulated throughout his body, melting the parts that had hardened like candle wax.

The more he swung his sword, the more smoothly his body moved, as if lubricant had been applied to the creaking parts. In deep immersion.

After a while, Helmut naturally emerged from his immersion.

‘Still not enough. I’ll need to do this for a few more days.’

Helmut raised his head. It was already night. No, dawn perhaps. He couldn’t tell.

The piece of metal in his grip asserted its presence heavily. It meant he was tired.

‘A sword……’

The only thing left to him.

That place, which had been Naho’s human farm, was full of weapons that had lost their owners. Although there were no longer any people left who could wield weapons.

It seems that bringing weapons into the Forest of Roots wasn’t prohibited.

Being sent to the Forest of Roots itself was a death sentence. Was there any need to take away weapons when sending someone to this place teeming with demonic beasts?

At least, they could show the final mercy of allowing one to end their own life before being eaten by monsters.

Anyway, one of the ownerless swords was in Helmut’s grip. Susan had brought it to him.

It was a sword with an unfamiliar feel. It was heavier than Darien’s sword that he used to use.

Darien’s sword. His master’s keepsake that had perfectly fit his hand.

‘Now I’ll never be able to wield that sword again.’

Because Darien’s sword was in Renosa. They might have melted it in a furnace to erase all traces. Just like they erased him.

In an instant, some kind of intense emotion swept over him. Hot and painful, and burning fiercely.

Helmut gritted his teeth tightly, and that pain slowly subsided.

But its aftereffects remained dully. The furrowed eyebrows slowly smoothed out. One becomes immune to any kind of pain.

He had to get used to it.

He had to overcome it.

Cold wind fills his lungs. What remains in the place once filled with ardent desire is only emptiness.

Now Helmut had to find something to fill that emptiness. Again.

He could do it. Because Helmut was still young. An immeasurably long time stretched out before him.

‘Darien, you said it. As long as I don’t lose myself, I can rise again.’

There were times when he almost completely collapsed. But in the moment when Helmut had lost himself, Elaga saved him.

Destruction was not allowed for Helmut. Because Elaga was there.

As long as Elaga was there, as long as he was in the Forest of Roots, Helmut bore an obligation. The obligation to live on.

So he picked up the sword.

‘I am not weak.’

Helmut was not a being weak enough to be engulfed by despair and struggle. He just needed a break.

It seems that even he didn’t believe deep in his heart that he would live on in a collapsed state.

Helmut had certainty. Certainty about himself. That certainty was brought by his sword, his strength.

That’s why only the sword remained.

\*

[Oh, finally.]

Elaga, who had been sauntering over, let out a short exclamation. It must have been quite frustrated all this time.

[Lazy kid. Why did it take so long?]

“I ate well.”

Helmut completely ignored Elaga and spoke to Susan for the first time, handing her the basket she had left.

It was completely empty inside. Yesterday, realizing Helmut had left his place, Susan had quietly left the basket.

Susan looked at Helmut as if bewildered. Sarah, who was standing holding her hand tightly, pointed at Helmut with wide eyes.

“He’s standing!”

To her, Helmut had been a somehow scary invalid who lay around all day doing nothing. The sudden change in his appearance was unfamiliar.

“How’s your body? It must be tough trying to train after so long.”

“It’s fine.”

Helmut answered business-like. Unlike Elaga’s intention, Helmut had no desire to become friendly with this mother and daughter. It was mere courtesy.

‘Courtesy……’

This too was something he had learned from the outside.

“Is that sword alright? There are other swords in the village, if you want, maybe you should look at them……”

“No.”

Unless it’s a famous sword like Darien’s, they’re all similar anyway. As long as he’s under Elaga’s shadow, there will be almost nothing to cut in this area of the Forest of Roots anyway.

Helmut, who had cut her off sharply, looked down at the sword in his hand. Its polished, gleaming surface caught his eye. The blade was also quite sharply honed.

Even though it must have been quite a long time since it lost its owner.

“The sword has been maintained.”

Susan smiled gently.

“My brother was a knight. I often saw him maintaining his sword. I tried to imitate it a bit.”



H.F.C Chapter 259 (Part 2):

`				`What flashed across her smile was sadness. Susan had survived, but her brother couldn’t escape death. She survived because she was a noble, but was exiled Instead.

“I was the daughter of a noble family. I lost everything except this child and was thrown into this forest. But still.”

What was revealed in Susan’s eyes was neither despair nor resignation. Rather, it was.

“I survived, and because of that, I have a future. No matter what my reality is, at least I can dream of the future. Because I’m alive.”

What was reflected in her eyes was hope and the will to live.

She may look frail on the outside, but she’s a strong woman. Helmut felt that.

Not physical strength, but inner strength. A kind that was hard to find among the humans of the Forest of Roots.

Even Darien, the strongest human Helmut had met, was under the shadow of despair and distrust.

As the two were making eye contact, Elaga tilted her head and exclaimed.

[Ooh, you two have a good atmosphere going?]

“Please don’t try to match us up, Elaga. Helmut is even younger than my youngest brother.”

Susan cut it off in a gentle tone. It felt strange to be treated like a child.

Elaga grumbled.

[To me, you all look about the same. Human lifespans are so dreadfully short.]

It felt like it was disappointed that it couldn’t create a new farm by matching them up.

Even while being treated like a pet, Susan seemed to have adapted to Elaga as she just smiled slightly and let it pass.

“And doesn’t Helmut have someone he left behind outside?”

Helmut raised an eyebrow.

“Elaga told you?”

“No, I just felt it. Your eyes…… They give the impression of someone who has left someone behind.”

[Anyway, if she’s that pretty, she’ll soon hit it off with some other guy.]

Helmut felt a strong urge to swing the sword in his hand. He couldn’t act on it only because it was an opponent he was bound to lose to.

“Elaga, such words are rude.”

[In the Forest of Roots, I am etiquette!]

“You’re hurting Helmut’s feelings. It’s not right for someone as strong as you, Elaga, to say things that hurt others.”

Susan spoke as if scolding a child. It seems their relationship isn’t as one-sided as it initially appeared.

[What did I do wrong?]

As Elaga grumbled and closed its mouth, Susan immediately looked at Helmut. It was a gaze full of trust to the point of being burdensome.

“Since you’ve gone out once, I’ll trust you then.”

‘What?’

So that’s what she means. That she intended to follow Helmut out. Helmut looked Susan over.

“You don’t have the Seed of Darkness.”

That’s an advantageous condition, but in exchange for not having the seed of darkness, she also doesn’t have Vis. She’s just an ordinary human woman.

But her body, which has eaten and drunk in the Forest of Roots, has a faint magical energy dwelling in it.

Because of that, holy power would burn her, and Susan wouldn’t be able to withstand the sacred barrier even for a moment.

At best, Elaga might be able to take her to the barrier, but even if she crossed the barrier, it was questionable whether Susan could protect herself from wild beasts. She looked far from capable of violence.

“You think I won’t be able to pass through the barrier, right?”

“Yes.”

It’s not just her. Helmut too, and that little girl over there. Crossing the barrier is currently impossible.

“I heard how Helmut left the Forest of Roots. But couldn’t there be other ways besides that method?”

“There could be. But.”

Helmut’s lips moved. His expressionless face crumbled slightly, distorting minutely.

“I have no reason to leave.”

“You have someone you left behind, don’t you?”

“She might…”

“You won’t know how she thinks of you until you meet her.”

Susan’s clear eyes spoke as if she knew without asking.

Alea already knows that Helmut has the Seed of Darkness. There was a special bond between them.

However, time makes one forget emotions and buries many things. Even if Helmut were to leave the Forest of Roots again, he didn’t know how many years it would take.

If even Alea…

As that thought occurred to him, a sharp pain surged up. A lump of malice writhing in his chest. Could he endure that situation?

There’s no Elaga in the outside world. If the Seed of Darkness goes berserk, Helmut will eventually meet the same end as that guy from before.

Only then did Helmut finally understand why Darien had given up on revenge.

Even if he left, there would only be empty revenge. What use is it if there’s nothing to grasp in this hand?

“Think about it slowly. Helmut has just gotten up, after all.”

Susan smiled kindly. Helmut realized why he felt she was strong.

The eyes of someone who has risen from despair. And she had a reason why she had to rise from despair.

That reason, who had been listening to their conversation with perked ears, raised her hand.

“I want to learn the sword!”

Sarah’s gaze was fixed on Helmut. It’s a determined face. As if that’s what she had wanted from the beginning. Helmut asked.

“Why do you want to learn the sword?”

Do you want to become strong and leave the Forest of Roots too? Like I did before. The question that arose in his mind. However, Sarah’s answer was a bit different from Helmut’s.

“Because I want to become strong! Because I don’t want to live weak! Mom’s hopeless and I’m young so I can become strong. I’ll become strong and protect mom!”

Sarah’s eyes were clear and bright.

Eyes full of determination.

Helmut knows a girl named Charlotte. She was a talented and strong swordswoman. Sarah’s talent is unknown, but if she comes from a sword family, there’s potential.

‘If a child without the Seed of Darkness becomes a swordswoman who can use Vis, she might be able to cross the barrier.’

Elaga nodded.

[Yeah, Sarah’s been running around swinging tree branches anyway. You should at least earn your keep for all you’ve eaten. Teach her some swordsmanship.]

It was already feeling very troublesome. But at least, Helmut now had something to do. These people would become his driving force.

Helmut soon nodded slowly.

“Alright.”



H.F.C Chapter 260 (Part 1):

`				`Sarah adapted to Helmut’s training better than expected. It wasn’t because she had a temperament that could withstand strenuous training. It was because she found it fun.

If Helmut was the type to focus on a single goal with perseverance and tenacity, Sarah enjoyed and loved swordsmanship itself.

‘That’s also a quality of a swordsman.’

Of course, Helmut didn’t put her through the harsh training that Darien had done to him.

Sarah’s training was similar to the first-year curriculum at the academy. It was about learning basic postures and Vis controlling methods.

‘I shouldn’t teach her crudely like Darien did.’

Darien was the type who would think that if Helmut had died, it wasn’t because of harsh training, but because he was weak.

Unlike him, Helmut prided himself on being a bit more cultured and sensible.

Since he had decided to teach, he would do so systematically, following the academy education like the instructors did.

Besides, she didn’t have a reason to push herself to death like Helmut did.

‘This child doesn’t have the Seed of Darkness. And for a girl, I’m not sure about her physical strength.’

The only example Helmut knew was Charlotte. Even then, he didn’t know much about her.

In a place where there were no proper doctors, let alone proper medicine, it would be a big problem if she fell ill or got sick.

Above all, Elaga watched with glaring eyes. It seemed worried that Helmut might do something to Sarah.

[You’re not going to go berserk again, are you? Once a person gets a taste, they might go for it again, so I have to keep an eye on you.]

Using that excuse, Elaga sat down near them and fidgeted.

Hunting was something it finished in no time during the morning anyway.

“My Seed of Darkness is in a stable state.”

Helmut replied with a confident tone and stroked his chest.

The Seed of Darkness, which had returned to the Forest of Roots, a cradle full of demonic energy, had been quite calm since it was drained of power by Elaga.

It seemed unlikely that he would go berserk again.

Not only would there be no more incidents to make him lose his reason, but even if it did go berserk, nothing serious would happen. Because Elaga was there.

‘Even without Elaga, I won’t allow the Seed of Darkness to dominate me again.’

Helmut vowed that he would never again let himself go so weakly. That was merely an escape and unworthy of a swordsman. If Darien had known, he would have scolded him harshly.

Helmut looked at the incredibly strong white leopard beside him for a moment and asked.

“What happened to Naho after I left?”

Suddenly, he became curious about it.

[You’re asking now? Of course, I won. I had a hard time draining its power because the one-headed thing was rampaging, intoxicated by its own venom. I had a bit more trouble swallowing and digesting the core of that ugly thing. What a hassle, cleaning up after you.]

“But you got stronger because of it.”

[I was already strong! There’s no use in getting even stronger!]

Elaga snorted. It was a story that would make others envious if they heard it. Helmut suddenly asked.

“Elaga, have you ever thought about leaving the Forest of Roots?”

Do magical beasts, no matter how intelligent, not think about leaving their home, the Forest of Roots?

Being so strong, doesn’t it dream of something new with that strength? Elaga was quite human-like for a magical beast. But its answer was indifferent.

[If I leave, I’ll probably just end up fighting humans who are shocked to see me. What’s the point of fighting humans I don’t even eat?]

“Like… traveling?”

Seeing different scenery, walking different paths, living a life other than as a demonic beast of the Forest of Roots.

However, Elaga seemed to have never thought about it even once.

[Travel? That’s a human concept. Why bother running around fussing over things?]

…No, it wasn’t because it was a magical beast, but because it had lived long enough to find everything troublesome.

Elaga’s diligence ended with taking care of humans.

[Are you perhaps asking me to break the barrier? How far are you going to make me clean up after you?]

Elaga burst out angrily.

“But, can you break it?”

He was genuinely curious if it was even possible. Elaga was silent for a moment.

Demonic beasts instinctively know how to measure the strength of their opponents.

For a Demonic beast like Elaga, who had lived for a long time and developed intelligence, the instincts that brought it these senses were even sharper.

‘Even if it’s not a living opponent, it should be able to sense it.’

But it seemed that even Elaga couldn’t easily judge. It spoke only after a while.

[What if I die trying? Will you take care of them?]

‘So the possibility is so low to the point that it might die.’

A barrier that even the ruler of a domain who had swallowed Naho’s core would risk its life to break.

Elaga’s entire body was a lump of magical energy. The barrier would reject it, a magical beast, with all its might.

Helmut had neither the intention nor the will to leave the Forest of Roots at the cost of Elaga’s life. That shouldn’t happen even if Elaga volunteered.

“No, never mind.”

[Just to be clear, it’s not because I’m weak! Any creature would say the same thing!]

“……”

[Why aren’t you answering! Are you ignoring me now?]

There was a brief commotion, but the conversation ended there.



H.F.C Chapter 260 (Part 2):

`				`Sarah was an active child.

During the time of Naho’s human farm, she had lived quietly in the village, but after meeting Elaga and being able to move around, she lived enjoying her freedom.

Thanks to running around freely under Elaga’s protection, she wasn’t like a typical noble girl without a single muscle in her hands, but had slightly tanned skin and good physical strength.

She had the basics for learning swordsmanship. And in some ways, she was more determined than Helmut.

“Hey, look at my posture. Is it right? Should I do it like this?”

“Lift your right arm, just a pinky’s width.”

“Like this? Is this it?”

Although she chattered incessantly, Sarah was enthusiastic about learning swordsmanship.

She wasn’t like Helmut, who had awakened his intelligence early due to the influence of the Seed of Darkness, but she was quite smart and persistent. This was probably due to the influence of magical energy to some extent.

Even while suffering from muscle pain, she didn’t try to give up learning the sword.

It wasn’t because Sarah was a persistent girl, but for a very simple reason.

“It’s super fun!”

‘There’s not much else to do here anyway.’

There weren’t many games for an active child to enjoy here. And she had probably tried most of them before Helmut appeared.

Elaga seemed displeased that Sarah wasn’t making flower crowns for it lately, but wielding a sword seemed to suit Sarah’s aptitude better than that.

‘It’s optimal for training.’

In the sense that one can focus solely without being distracted by other things. It was the same for Helmut.

While taking care of Sarah, Helmut also focused on his own training, and he was gradually able to shake off his memories of the human world.

“Kyaa! Look at this.”

About three months after starting to learn the sword, Sarah exclaimed excitedly as she succeeded in cutting a tree in half.

Since there was a short sword among the ownerless swords that she could handle, albeit heavily, she had been training with a real sword from the beginning.

Helmut said in a nonchalant tone.

“Yeah.”

Then, after a moment, he briefly added.

“Well done.”

Still, he remembered enough of what he learned in the human world to know what to say in such situations.

Sarah showed a bright smile.

“Right? I’m good, aren’t I?”

Even for Helmut, who had attended the Greta Academy where only prodigies gather, Sarah’s achievement seemed decent.

‘Quite fast.’

First of all, the environment was good. The Forest of Roots is full of magical energy, which also means that the entire forest is full of vitality.

In the Forest of Roots, one can achieve progress faster than in any training ground in the outside world.

Sarah was in the early stages of beginning to accept Vis. Right now, she was at the level of wielding a sword with some strength, but gradually she would be able to imbue Vis into her sword.

‘That time might come sooner than expected.’

Although it wouldn’t be comparable to the speed of Helmut’s achievements.

“How’s Sarah? Is she not bothering Helmut too much?”

“It doesn’t matter.”

Susan often asked Helmut about Sarah. Although the time they spent talking wasn’t long, the initial aversion he felt while being with Susan and Sarah had diluted.

Helmut was gradually getting used to this mother and daughter.

\*

“What will you do when you leave the Forest of Roots?”

Helmut asked Sarah one day. Like Helmut, Sarah had almost no memories left of the outside world.

No, Sarah disliked remembering itself. Perhaps because the situation in which she left was so shocking.

Sarah’s answer was simple.

“Umm, I’ll eat sweets. The food here is terrible…”

It was a truly trivial goal. She seemed to be feeling something similar to what Helmut had felt before.

Hadn’t he also felt like leaving the Forest of Roots after eating the food Darien made?

‘It’s better now than it was then.’

Because Susan makes fairly tasty human food.

A daughter of a noble family rarely has to enter the kitchen.

Yet, Susan was quite skilled in cooking. According to her, she learned from other women when she was living in the human farm before. Although she was the only one among those women who survived.

‘The human world…’

Helmut looked down at his hands. While teaching Sarah the sword, Helmut had also made progress.

Since he wasn’t taking classes at the academy, he could invest more time in the sword than he could outside.

And Helmut was feeling it. That he, who had taken up the sword again, was different from before. Of course, in a good way.

‘Is it because I faced death?’

He had met a truly strong enemy and fought against them. And he had rampaged through the Forest of Roots under the control of the Seed of Darkness.

Like steel that had been tempered, Helmut’s vessel had become harder and larger after going through two arduous experiences in a row.

When he looked back at his condition after recovering his Vis, he felt that his level as a swordsman had grown.

Now, Helmut had to fill that vessel.

‘But…’

A cool wind blows in his chest. He couldn’t completely shake off the helplessness seeping into a corner of his mind.

The past Helmut had a ball of fire burning inside him. There was something he wanted to pour all his energy into, even if it meant consuming himself. Life without that something was empty.

No matter how much he swung his sword and trained, there was an emptiness that couldn’t be filled.

Helmut thought. If he focused on what he could do, wouldn’t change come someday?

What he could do was the same as in the past. Getting stronger.

Swordsmen sometimes hit the limits of their talent. But the Seed of Darkness allows one to surpass the limits that a human would normally have. This applied to talent as well.

Helmut could become endlessly strong. Really, until he reached some unknown end.

‘Revenge.’

Helmut brushed past that word. Even though he felt the Seed of Darkness stirring in his chest for a moment.

A hot, bitter gust of wind followed like an aftershock.

‘It’s about living.’

Even if there was no hope or passion.

As long as he was alive, he had to keep living. That was what Helmut had to do.

Time flowed smoothly like a river, but quickly.
