Helmut was aware of this but didn’t really pay it any mind. Was there a reason to?

‘After all, I have no rivals in the second year.’

Helmut felt no alarm at the word ‘if.’ An ‘if’ had to be significant enough to matter.

The gap between him and the second-ranking, Asuka, was enormous. If the other second-year students were crawling on the ground, he was flying in the sky.

He had learned to fly freely, casting off shackles, a sensation impossible for those bound to the earth.

It was as improbable as an infant defeating a knight.

‘Even if I were to catch a cold and run a high fever, the outcome would be the same.’

Thus, he could afford to be relaxed about the upcoming comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Even if he had won the martial arts tournament among the elite Palma Knights of Basor, how could a student competition hold any concern for him? He was not arrogant to think so.

Alea agreed with him.

“If it’s you, winning is a given. They’re about to announce the location of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, but think of it as a leisurely trip. The prize money isn’t insignificant either.”

Helmut, however, had been distracted by other matters lately.

Of course, being distracted didn’t mean he neglected his duties. He maintained his training schedule and was diligent during classes.

It was only outside these times that a change had occurred, specifically concerning Alea.

The two would run into each other every morning or afternoon in the hallway, separated by a single door.

As if they could naturally walk into each other’s rooms if someone happened to show up, they would briefly chat. Fortunately, this didn’t happen often, so they could leisurely converse.

Although Asuka and Sian could be nuisances, this was a secluded end corridor.

One day, as the preliminaries drew near, Alea clasped something onto Helmut’s wrist.

It was a bracelet with finely engraved silver patterns.

It was neither thick nor heavy, but as with most ornaments, it felt somewhat cumbersome. Now he had another one to wear.

“What’s this?”

“A bracelet. Since you seemed to wear the one I gave you before quite well, consider this a reward.”

Helmut stared at her intensely for a moment. Was it an illusion to feel like he was wearing two dog collars?

He had never used the first bracelet she had given him to summon her.

This too was a magical bracelet. He could feel a faint magical aura enveloping it.

“What function does this have?”

Alea casually mentioned.

“Well, I’ve been doing some research on ‘that’.”

‘That’ would likely be the seed of darkness. Helmut felt as if he had become a subject of observation for Alea, much like Sian’s spirit.



H.F.C Chapter 201 (Part 2):
				Being a mage, Alea couldn’t possibly remain indifferent to the existence of a human with a seed of darkness she had never encountered before.

Alea had a different kind of interest in Helmut, though separate from affection.

‘If it’s interest, then so be it.’

Alea had no intention of using him as a test subject, but she occasionally poked and prodded at him, casting unknown, harmless spells.

While it was a strange feeling to be the subject of curiosity, Helmut let her be.

It seemed she had achieved some results in her research.

“So you need to hide ‘that’, right? But if someone is particularly perceptive, they might notice under certain conditions, like those white ones.”

She spoke cryptically, but it was understandable.

‘The white ones’ referred to the temple. The second high priest they met, Pascal, had been slower to react than the first, Dolos. Helmut suspected Pascal had not immediately noticed the dark seed within him.

But sensitivity varied among the high priests.

A more perceptive high priest might immediately sense the dark energy within the seed of darkness.

“It’s because of the temple’s permission that the academy of Baden could participate in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament. If they attend, who knows if they might observe something. That’s why I thought about what we could do.”

Despite knowing of Pascal’s disappearance, the temple had not made a fuss or pursued the matter aggressively.

Alea, who often met with the dean, was aware of this.

Nonetheless, it was difficult to believe that they held no suspicions about the academy in Baden.

The timing was too coincidental. Just visiting Baden and then encountering them on their way elsewhere!

‘What’s done is done.’

Alea thought that Helmut must not get caught up in anything during the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament if the priests were watching.

The solution wasn’t simple. First and foremost, he should not manifest vis in its usual form. The dark energy carried by Helmut’s ashen Vis was unavoidable.

‘The trace of dark energy that seeps out when using Vis…’

Alea decided to approach the problem from a different angle.

“This bracelet creates a thin barrier around it to block the outburst of dark energy. Think of it as a derivative of my artifact. It won’t be as effective as the magic of my artifact, which overlays illusions, but it’s more natural since it’s mixed with cleansing magic, making it harder to detect.”

A modest amount of artifact use was permitted in combat, whether in a swordsmanship contest or a martial arts tournament. It wasn’t simply a matter of fighting bare-handed.

Participants could bring better weapons and wear better armor, as long as it wasn’t excessive.

“Thank you.”

Helmut grasped Alea’s hand eagerly. Alea smiled slightly.

“That doesn’t look like a thankful expression.”

Helmut’s expressions were almost always unreadable. This time was no different.

“Is that so?”

After a moment’s thought, Helmut reached out and pulled Alea into a tight embrace. Alea complied quietly.

Her hair rustled softly, and her body was frailer than it appeared, a natural consequence of her magic.

His heart thumped pleasantly. Dark emotions like malice, despair, and murderous intent fed the seed of darkness. What about such feelings then?

Helmut wondered.

One thing was certain: lately, the seed of darkness had not grown. It was quiet. He formed a hypothesis.

‘Could the thumping of my heart and its warmth enhance my control over the seed of darkness?’

Whether or not the hypothesis was correct, even if nurturing the seed of darkness, Helmut did not want to push Alea away.

If there had been any progress in their relationship, it was that their contact had become more natural. Alea, still disguised, was highly cautious of her surroundings, so timing was crucial.

“You inspire me. I’ve never before studied how to use magic for someone else. But look, I’ve made not one, but two bracelets for you.”

Alea spoke as if delighted.

‘Sounds like affection for a test subject.’

That was just the way of a mage.

Lifting her head while nestled in his arms, Alea’s eyes sparkled like stars.

“This weekend, there’s a place I’d like us to visit.”

“Alright.”

Asuka had suggested something, but it hardly mattered.

Helmut maintained a balance, spending half of his weekends with his friends, Asuka and Sian.

He sometimes visited the Kudrow Mansion with Alea, but not always.

Helmut actually wanted to lose that balance. But there was still much time ahead, and Alea was exceedingly careful.

‘Dating you might get us caught off-guard at any moment. One must always be vigilant about how things could turn out.’

Being caught in a romantic relationship might be better than being suspected of an inappropriate relationship between male students.

That could place their guardians, the dean and the instructor, in difficult positions.

The dean knew the truth, but Ethan Kudrow would be shocked to know Alea was a girl.

For that reason, Helmut was extra vigilant about their surroundings when with Alea.

“Remember the place we went for the last assignment?”

“Ah, yes.”

Lampione’s dungeon. Helmut didn’t say it aloud, but Alea nodded.

“It looks like it’s safe to enter now. I’ve been stabilizing it bit by bit each holiday. It was a complete mess, but it’s been cleaned up now. You had a stake in it too, didn’t you?”

“Is there treasure?”

“I don’t know. We’ll find out when we go in.”



H.F.C Chapter 202 (Part 1):
				The dungeon was a culmination of all that Lampione had amassed throughout his life.

It held not only his magical legacy but also his vast wealth.

In fact, it was his wealth that drew other mages to seek out his dungeon.

‘A dungeon would be a place undisturbed by anyone else.’

Helmut felt drawn to that idea. He and Alea were too conspicuous, making it hard to avoid attention. In comparison, this place seemed safer.

It seemed rumors had spread about them wandering the streets during their assignment period.

The dormitory rooms were suitable places too, but the problem was Alea’s reputation for being prickly and exclusive in personality.

No matter how close they were, it looked odd to others for Alea to always have Helmut in her room, and vice versa.

‘This is difficult.’

Had he ever expected to agonize over finding a suitable date spot?

While he couldn’t stop Asuka and Sian from complaining about his exclusive time with Alea, at least the issue of location was resolved.

“Isn’t it dangerous? Maybe. But there might be some stubborn ones there.”

Alea shrugged lightly.

They had taken control of the space, but Lampione’s golems remained inside the dungeon. Whether they would readily accept a new master was uncertain.

Helmut somewhat regarded this as cleaning up after their last dungeon venture.

‘This exploration might not be peaceful.’

Since the direction also allowed for sword training, it didn’t really matter to him.

Helmut nodded.

“Alright.”

Sian had been harboring suspicions lately. He considered himself quicker and wittier than others, a sentiment Asuka couldn’t deny.

‘There’s something odd about those two.’

Helmut and Alea had grown noticeably closer recently.

They were often seen whispering together, as if plotting something.

Most of all, their eyes changed when they looked at each other. That subtle current between them.

‘Something must have happened during the assignment.’

He knew there was an understanding between them that others weren’t privy to. They had known each other even before enrolling at the academy.

Both Helmut and Alea were reserved about their personal lives.

Many had tried to dig into Alea’s past due to her fame, but none had succeeded.

A suspicion grew within Sian.

“Could it be Alea…? No, that’s ridiculous.”

“What is?”

His oblivious friend Asuka asked curiously. Sian dismissed it with a smile.

‘Yeah, how could that be possible here at Greta Academy?’

Someday, he would be able to confirm his suspicions. There was no need to rush.

*

When the weekend finally arrived, Helmut and Alea promptly headed to the dungeon in the forest near Baden.

After teleporting to a secluded location, Alea drew a dense and intricate magic circle on the ground.

“I’m summoning the dungeon entrance here. You can access specific areas by embedding markers or creating permanent entrances, but I’ve cut off all entrances so no one can get in. This is the only way in.”

“Can anyone summon it if they know how to draw the circle?”

Helmut watched the magic circle with interest.

He could memorize its form without missing a detail. He could redraw it anytime.

A magic circle operates by being infused with magical power. So, if one draws the circle and infuses it with power, the entrance should open, right?

However, Alea shook her head.

“I told you this dungeon is bound to me. So, the magic’s properties must also match.”

Before entering the dungeon, Alea spoke softly to Helmut.

“I have a favor to ask.”

As Helmut looked at her silently, Alea quickly stated her request.

“Whatever happens inside, please try to avoid damaging anything? While dungeon damage can be repaired, the items inside, like the furniture attached to a house, cannot. Each item is a product of Lampione’s research.”

It was now Alea’s property. Though it might resist her slightly as if reluctant to become her property, she had to restrain it without destroying it.

Lampione’s sophisticated golems were as much a product of high magic as Heike’s artifacts.

Alea smiled, excited about re-entering the dungeon.

‘I’ll take good care of your legacy, Lampione.’

Whether Lampione had tried to take her body or not, Alea bore no ill will towards him.

She knew there could be challenges. Now that she had the dungeon, her expectations were high. She planned to make good use of it.

“Be careful.”

Helmut nodded. It sounded like he was being told to fight with restrictions, but it would be interesting.



H.F.C Chapter 202 (Part 2):
				This was a real test. After fighting with full force against the temple, he had progressed in his achievements.

Fighting under intense pressure and guarding against sacred magic, Helmut had exhausted his physical and mental strength, which had advanced his skills.

Battles that risked one’s life were good ways to improve one’s skills.

“I’m opening the door now.”

As soon as Alea declared it, she infused the magic circle with power.

A bright light traced an oval line over the glowing magic circle.

It was a door large enough for one person to enter. Through it, a glimpse of the dungeon’s scenery could be seen – the place that had nearly become their grave.

Alea stepped through first. Her body passed through the passage with the light. Helmut followed closely behind.

Moments later, they were fully inside the dungeon. The door closed behind them.

Helmut looked around and spoke.

“It looks different from last time?”

“I reconstructed it, in my own style.”

Alea shrugged. Unlike the previous dungeon, which had been a series of empty rooms, the interior was now decorated like a noble’s mansion.

Luxurious green wallpaper with prominent golden patterns caught the eye. A fireplace with crackling flames for some reason.

Antique furniture and the layout of the interior gave it a cozy, charming mansion feel.

“I designed it thinking of my workshop. Lampione’s space had some unique magic that almost perfectly realized whatever I envisioned. I don’t need to buy anything specific; I just need to think concretely.”

“You must feel like a god here, being able to shape space at will.”

“Not quite. Shaping space takes a lot of magic, and creating something from nothing even more so. The dungeon is fundamentally made of magic. Manifesting non-material into material is godlike in the real world, and even in a dungeon, it’s incredibly difficult.”

Her tone wasn’t boastful. She wasn’t bragging.

But her words implied something significant: that it was possible because Alea was that skilled a mage, a mage on her way to becoming an archmage.

Most mages couldn’t even dream of becoming an archmage.

While swordsmanship required talent, magic had an absolute boundary that couldn’t be reached by effort alone.

Exceptional intellect, the talent to handle magic, and the right environment—all were necessary.

Helmut had recognized Alea’s power as a powerful mage the moment he first saw her. That’s why he had not made her an enemy.

They had become close under the guise of tutoring. There was no calculation in it. But perhaps it was instinct?

However, what was certain was that dating Alea was not due to any event or confrontation.

If Alea became an enemy, Helmut would suffer a fatal blow. He had never exposed such a vulnerability to anyone before.

“Could you create a training ground for me?”

Helmut asked abruptly. Alea laughed.

“Planning to come often, huh? A training ground.”

“It would be better than a cafe. You could read, and I could train instead of reading.”

A hint of dissatisfaction could be felt in Helmut’s words.

Alea placed her hands on her hips, lecturing in a strict manner that was quite endearing.

“Reading nourishes the mind. Books are treasure troves of knowledge. I thought you had developed a liking for reading?”

It seemed it was planned. Even when they shared a room, Alea had retained her tutor-like demeanor, always checking if Helmut was studying diligently.

She often recommended books that would be helpful for his classes.

Regardless, Helmut diligently read the books she suggested. It wasn’t enjoyable at all.

“Mystery novels are fun, but they’re pointless.”

Helmut was a pragmatist. The mentality of securing victory in the most efficient way was something he learned from Darien.

Having lived through harsh routines in the Forest of Roots, he found enjoyable books a waste of time that didn’t really help.

“I want to train.”

“But you are strong.”

“My enemies are strong too.”

Helmut answered firmly. He had dealt with two high priests.

Doesn’t that mean he no longer needs to fear the temple? Helmut thought.

But the knights he had faced were not the temple’s elite forces, just a group escorting a high priest to Baden.

Moreover, the enemy hadn’t known his identity. Helmut had fought in the forest, a battlefield favorable for fighting many with few. All these factors had aided him.

Alea, too, had thwarted a potentially fatal strike against him.

If the high priest had succeeded in casting purification magic, Helmut would have been at least incapacitated.

‘If they had known my identity, they wouldn’t have fought that way.’

He had never faced a prepared temple. The temple’s knights were said to be as powerful as the Palma Knights.

Someday, Helmut would have to prepare for when his identity is revealed. It wasn’t time to be complacent with just this level of achievement.

‘Alea isn’t letting her guard down about possibly being discovered as a woman in disguise at the academy either.’

It was similar to that. It wasn’t the time to be comfortable with the current situation. Alea seemed to understand this as she nodded.

“I’ll consider the training ground. The space needs to be large enough, and it must withstand Vis. If possible, I’ll make it conducive to Vis training.”

Alea pondered for a moment, then asked.

“Shall I let you open the entrance? Hmm? No, that might be risky. Maybe when I’m present. There are still many parts of this dungeon I don’t fully understand.”

Alea slowly walked towards the fireplace.

As she placed her hand on a spot, the fireplace naturally slid to one side.

Grrr! A secret passage quickly formed behind the fireplace. It was a mystical hidden passage.

Though somewhat unnecessary within an inaccessible dungeon, it seemed to suit Alea’s tastes.

Alea gestured to Helmut.

“Let’s go.”



H.F.C Chapter 203 (Part 1):
				The only space materialized according to Alea’s will was the first one alone. From there on, empty rooms unfolded.

Spaces that felt desolate like ruins, partially collapsed.

Alea had mentioned that even constructing the entrance consumed a great deal of magical power.

Helmut tilted his head.

“This dungeon, isn’t it quite large?”

“Right, so it will take time to refine the whole thing. It’s going to be a big project.”

“Is my training ground feasible, then?”

“If it’s just about creating a stable, wide open space, we can work it out here. It should be fine for training with Vis. However, in terms of efficiency, it might not match the academy’s training grounds. Building your official training ground will be a new challenge.”

“How will you cover the magic power needed?”

Lampione did not construct this dungeon overnight.

Even though ascending to the level of an Archmage smooths out the flow of magical power, this dungeon wasn’t made in a day.

‘It would take the combined magical power of all the students in Greta Academy’s magic department to bring it to its proper form.’

Helmut felt the same. Just as a good home requires a lot of work, so does a dungeon.

“Lampione’s dungeon had a revolutionary structure that was incredibly efficient in terms of magical power consumption. This dungeon itself is a creation of Lampione. I don’t know the method, so it took time even to construct the entrance, but I’m researching it. It will take some time, but it’s worth researching.”

Alea spoke with a face full of motivation.

Lately, Alea had been especially vibrant. As soon as she entered the dungeon, she stripped away her magic and returned to her original form. It was a welcome change for Helmut.

Alea looked like a girl rather than the cold, haughty second-year top student of Greta Academy’s magic department.

Helmut didn’t place high odds that it was because of him. He was still unsure about that part.

“But as I mentioned before, there are things to do first.”

Alea pointed ahead with the tip of her finger. Magical energy could be felt from all directions.

What looked like random stones placed far ahead. Upon closer inspection, they were golems.

They seemed familiar. The ones Helmut had slashed were now inexplicably intact and lying dormant, cores shattered yet still alive, which was surprising.

“The cores implanted in them don’t lose life force until completely shattered. If time passes while rooted in the dungeon, they automatically restore themselves. They’re as tenacious as weeds. That’s why the golems remain closer to their original forms too.”

Lampione’s golems had attack capabilities and physical recovery similar to magical beasts. Moreover, they absolutely obeyed their master.

Although their intelligence is unclear, they were formidable forces in themselves. Helmut realized:

“They would be useful militarily.”

Perhaps the culmination of Lampione’s lifelong research. If Lampione had a bit more time, he might well have created an army.

It doesn’t suit a mage’s nature, but if he had, he might have conquered the world.

“If this were known, every nation would have coveted Lampione’s legacy.”

“Fortunately, it remained unknown. As you know, I was the first to discover Lampione’s dungeon. And mass-producing these golems would be difficult. The materials are very expensive, and each requires a lot of work.”

“For research like that, it would have drawn attention. Why didn’t it become known?”

“Lampione thoroughly hid his golem research. He didn’t want his magical achievements being used for destruction or war. In that sense, he was close to being unambitious. He was just a scholar.”

His first and last malevolent decision was to take over a successor’s body.

Even that, due to his unfamiliarity with malevolent acts, was inadequately executed and ended in a resounding failure.

Nevertheless, Lampione’s honor would be preserved. Fortunately, those who could divulge the fact had secured his legacy.

Helmut stepped towards the cluster of golems. They were originally arranged in each room, but now they were simply scattered around the open field.

Apparently, Lampione had a taste for the grotesque, as their forms were oddly unappealing, Some had a strange shape like centipedes.

“Can their form be changed?”

“Yeah, but before that we should disable them in combat first to examine them. Just don’t smash them too harshly.”

From what she was saying, dealing with the golems seemed entirely Helmut’s responsibility. Just enough to shatter them.

As Helmut approached, the golems’ eyes lit up one by one with an automatic attack command.

Helmut drew his sword from his waist. A thin veil of gray Vis appeared over the blade. The golems were too solid to be cut without it.

‘Finally, some real action.’

There was no need for Alea to fight alongside him. The golems were threatening enough for ordinary people.

They possessed power no less than actual demonic beasts, and their metallic or stone skin was harder than a beast’s. Having faced them once before, he was fully familiar with their patterns.

‘I need to aim for the core to disable their functions. I just have to do it like last time.’

It seemed possible to recover as long as the core wasn’t completely split in half.

Whack! The golem sprung from the ground and charged at him like a missile. This time, there were no limits or constraints.

Helmut extended his Vis-charged sword and effortlessly shattered the golem. Crunch! Crack! Pieces fell to the ground in a heap.

In less than 20 minutes, Helmut could defeat every golem he visually confirmed.



H.F.C Chapter 203 (Part 2):
				Only after confirming their immobility did Alea approach. With a curious gaze, she examined the shattered golems.

From the magic power she was raising, it seemed she was changing their allegiances. Helmut asked:

“If they’re rooted in the dungeon, why don’t they obey you as the dungeon’s master?”

“These ones were made to be operated outside the dungeon. They’re individual existences separate from the dungeon. I have to change the allegiance of each one.”

Alea added admiringly as she examined the golem,

“I knew Lampione was a genius, but I didn’t realize he had done so much research on golems. It’s impressive. If I had lived in his era… I might have felt inferior to him.”

Helmut thought differently.

“Lampione might have felt inferior to you.”

“You think so?”

As Alea walked towards the golems, she changed the subject.

“You too. Listening to your story, my own challenging life seemed peaceful by comparison. You’re the first human to have left the Forest of Roots. I couldn’t have done what you did. I probably would have died the moment I entered the forest.”

“Luck played a part.”

“Luck… you mean them?”

“Yes, my master and Elaga.”

It felt awkward to refer to Elaga as a parent.

Helmut had human parents, and Elaga had not taken him in and raised him as a parent would.

It was more about securing food than nurturing or raising him.

Elaga was just Elaga.

If Helmut missed anything, it was likely Elaga’s warm body and soft fur.

It was exceptionally comforting to cling to that in cold weather.

Alea opened her mouth with a serene expression.

“…When you have time, won’t you tell me more about them? How you grew up in the Forest of Roots, what life was like there. We can talk about that here.”

Somehow, Alea had not broached the subject of the Forest of Roots before.

Choosing the right place for such topics was important, as they were not to be mentioned casually.

They were both curious about each other’s stories.

And it seemed Helmut had more stories to tell, given the many incidents in his life.

Helmut nodded.

“First, let’s check the legacy, then slowly.”

From afar, at the edge of the clearing, a small hole appeared. Just large enough for one person to bend down and step through.

It was blocked by a golem, almost like a gatekeeper, which is why it had gone unnoticed.

“Alright.”

Alea readily agreed.

The hole didn’t lead directly to a treasure vault. Inside was an intricately tangled maze.

The paths branched off complexly, some sloped or narrow. Sometimes they circled back to the original spot.

There was no particular danger, but the two wandered the dungeon for a long time. Helmut had to pull Alea back from the sloped paths several times.

Alea explained as if to make excuses.

“The different parts of this akspace have become jumbled and chaotic. I still can’t control this aspect of it.”

“Does this lead all the way to Lampione’s legacy?”

“Yes, when I took over the dungeon, my strongest desire was to connect the path to Lampione’s legacy.”

Magic is the power to realize will and desire. The dungeon had made a path.

Just that it was not easy, perhaps reflecting even the former owner’s will.

But soon, they reached the end.

“Over here. There’s a door.”

Emerging from the narrow cave path, a massive door appeared before them.

The entrance was adorned with intricate magical patterns, clearly no ordinary door. There was no handle.

Perhaps it could be pushed open from the side or inside. Without much thought, Helmut reached out to try opening the door.

At that moment, crackle! A spark flew. Helmut raised his Vis to block the current and raised an eyebrow.

“I guess you’ll have to do it?”

“There’s a defensive spell placed on it. Lampione must have layered numerous spells here. This must be the place.”

Alea clapped, and as soon as her hand touched it instead of Helmut’s, the door opened.

Alea quickly stepped inside. The musty smell of old books wafted out.

A vast library with shelves filled to the ceiling appeared before them. The scale was such that it required a ladder to reach the books, about ten times a person’s height.

Excitement flickered in the eyes of Alea, a bookworm, at the overwhelming sight.

“Lampione’s library. As expected, Lampione built this as the most secure place in the dungeon. It’s preserved in near-perfect condition with minimal damage. Look at those ancient tomes! There are rarer books here than most academies have. Almost half are magic books. There are so many I haven’t read!”

However, musty books were not important to Helmut.

He looked at the library crammed full of books like it was an obstruction he wanted to burn down.

“So where exactly is the treasure hidden?”

That was what mattered to Helmut. It was well concealed.

“It’s somewhere inside… There must be a path leading on. Mages connect libraries with their laboratories and storerooms.”

But at first glance, the inside of the library seemed to stretch endlessly with only bookshelves. An enclosed space filled solely with books.

Alea scanned the bookshelves and noticed one book with an unusually shiny spine.

“This must be one of Lampione’s works. Maybe this is it.”

The moment she pressed on the book’s spine, a change occurred.



H.F.C Chapter 204 (Part 1):
				It was an astonishing treasure trove, as if they had discovered the legendary treasure island. Helmut raised his gaze upwards.

‘I’ve heard mages are wealthy, but…’

This was far beyond mere wealth. Would even an emperor of an empire possess such a treasure vault?

Lampione may have been richer than the king of an entire nation.

Helmut, who had remained composed even when receiving Darien’s inheritance, was awestruck.

But truly, it was a sight to make one’s eyes go wide. Alea’s eyes had also grown large, undoubtedly feeling similar.

A mountain of gold coins piled nearly to the ceiling. If it collapsed, it could easily bury someone.

Unlike the neatly organized library, the gold and jewels were haphazardly stacked without care.

The most precious gems were set aside, with rudimentary preservation magic cast upon them, but they did not seem to be properly managed.

Nevertheless, the treasures, untouched by the passing of time, sparkled brightly enough to dazzle the eyes.

Except for matters related to magic, Lampione seemed to have no interest whatsoever, as this scene clearly demonstrated.

Alea murmured,

“It’s incredible. He hoarded nearly as much as Heike.”

Helmut flinched. That meant even Alea’s mentor had this much wealth. Alea would inherit it, although it wasn’t hers yet.

Helmut estimated his own share,

“Even half of this would be immense.”

“You can take more. But moving it all at once would attract attention.”

“Let’s just take what we need for now.”

Alea would not simply take the money for herself.

For her, like Lampione, wealth was a means to an end—a means to acquire materials for magical experiments.

For a highly skilled mage, it was only a matter of time before they could amass fortunes.

Helmut decided to fill the subspace pocket from the clothes he took from Talon with as many gold coins and gems as he could for now. It was an extravagant reward compared to his past labors.

‘Dungeon exploration is far more efficient than mercenary work.’

All it took was smashing a few golems, an easy task. So easy that if there were other archmages’ dungeons, he would want to raid them again.

But such things wouldn’t be ownerless. A mage of that caliber would have disciples to inherit his legacy.

Alea also took some gold coins.

“This should buy many mana stones. It’ll be a great help in restructuring the dungeon. And it might speed up the construction of your training ground. But where are the grimoires?”

Alea wasn’t concerned about that. Leaving Helmut behind, she walked deeper into the treasure vault.

With her keen eye, she spotted a small symbol carved on the wall beyond the mountain of gold.

“Over here.”

When she imbued it with magic, the wall slid open, creating an entrance. Alea stepped inside.

It was another subspace, similar to a library but empty.

Except for a few grimoires placed high on a pedestal at the center.

The area around it was enveloped in layers of strong magic—preservation and protection spells far more robust than those outside.

It was clear what Lampione valued more.

‘Can’t approach it without dispelling the magic first.’

Alea spent some time successfully undoing Lampione’s spells.

The delay was partly because she was excited. How long had she waited for this day?

‘Almost there.’

Soon, Alea’s hand touched one of Lampione’s grimoires. The magic essence Lampione had left behind recorded in a thick, large leather book.

Joy shimmered in Alea’s eyes. Helmut silently watched her rapidly reading through the grimoire.

The moment a wish is fulfilled, one feels reborn.

Just like when Helmut first stepped out of the Forest of Roots into the human world.

Soon, Alea turned around to share her joy, her face blossoming with a smile.

She was radiant as if glowing. It was the first time he had seen her so happy.

“We did it! Look at this.”

“Yes.”

Helmut nodded. He felt satisfaction from Alea’s reaction.

Not I, but we. The divide that had separated them was gradually dissolving into one.

That bond gave Helmut a sense of belonging he had never experienced before.

The change in his relationship with Alea made him feel many things.

Emotions he had never experienced before. As if he had entered a new world.

‘This must be a good thing.’

Even if he needed to steady himself from becoming too relaxed. Holding Alea’s hand had been the right choice. Helmut felt it anew.

After an hour, both were ready to leave the dungeon. Alea put her bracelet back on.

“Shall we go?”

They had obtained everything they aimed for. They would likely visit this place on holidays.

They left the dungeon feeling satisfied. However, something was secretly following them.

It was a small and faint presence, not enough to be considered a threat. It moved stealthily in the darkness.

The darkness was its domain, and it could follow them without being noticed if it wished. It was confident in that.

But the moment Alea opened the dungeon exit, the entrance was flooded with light.



H.F.C Chapter 204 (Part 2):
				The creature quickly threw itself into the light. If it didn’t follow quickly, even it might get trapped in the dungeon.

While entering the dungeon had allowed it to blend in with the dungeon’s energy, making its presence undetectable, it was a different story when exiting.

“What’s that? There’s something there!”

Alea turned around, and Helmut swung his sword toward the creature that had followed them out.

The creature, shocked, darted into the shadow of a tree. It tried to move along the shadow but was quickly bound by a powerful spell. It was a spatial lock.

Peeking out from the tree shadow, the creature appeared as an indistinct mass enveloped in black mist.

Approaching with his sword drawn, Helmut frowned. He immediately recognized what it was.

“This is…..”

“A spirit of darkness? One that lived in the dungeon? Or perhaps…”

If Lampione’s collection didn’t include a spirit, then its master must only be the person they knew.

Then, a scream-like shout came from afar.

“Woah! Stop! It’s my spirit!”

A silhouette suddenly burst out, yelling like a scream with a flustered expression.

“Sian…?”

The atmosphere froze. Sian quickly approached and pulled the spirit of darkness out from the tree’s shadow.

After securing his spirit, Sian scratched the back of his head, an awkward smile spreading across his face.

Helmut asked coldly,

“Why are you here?”

“Haha! That could happen. Why are you looking at me like I’m something to eat? You two have been sticking together so much lately, I was curious about what you do on weekends.”

He conveniently left out that he had been watching them out of suspicion. Luckily, his suspicions were unfounded.

‘They’ve been doing that together!’

They had been having such fun together, how could they be so sneaky?

He had been watching through the dark spirit but regretted not being able to join them.

The looks from Helmut and Alea were cold.

What had he found out? What did he know? They had to make him spill it all.

There were secrets Sian could know and secrets he mustn’t know.

They might have to silence him by any means necessary if needed.

Alea whispered to Helmut,

“Spirit mages share the spirit’s sight and thoughts, so memories can’t be erased.”

Killing to silence him was the only way. Sian, sharing senses with the spirit, heard those words too.

“Hey, Alea! What do you mean by erasing memories, that’s so sinister! Hey, Helmut! Why are you nodding? You’d do that to a friend? How did you two pass the academy’s ethics exams!”

“Ethics exams are just exams in the end.”

Alea cut in coldly. If Helmut was conflicted about what to do, Alea was ruthless.

They had to manage Sian somehow. While Helmut could go as far as murder, Alea was more hesitant.

They weren’t too close, but Sian was a fellow student at the academy. Killing him was a hesitant option for her, and Helmut likely felt the same.

‘So he’s curious enough to follow us this far, pretty bold.’

Tracking through a spirit was hard to detect. That’s why spirit mages were treated specially, but he had gone too far this time.

Helmut rested his hand on his sword. His jet black eyes exuded pressure by just looking, but exuded more threat when he revealed killing intent.

“Tell me what you’ve found out.”

There were things Sian could know and couldn’t. The paled Sian confessed readily.

“Alea inherited Lampione’s legacy? I heard the professors talking about it. Recently, Lampione’s dungeon was raided, and someone inherited the archmage’s legacy. I didn’t know it was you, Alea.”

Sian shrugged.

“I just found out today. Let me say though, I couldn’t see much. The connection gets hazy entering that subspace. Sharing sight with my spirit was blurred and vague. This one just watched from afar. All I know is the inside seems like a dungeon with lots of shiny stuff?”

“Is that true?”

Helmut asked. Not really addressing Sian. Alea nodded.

“Yes, when spaces separate, the binding weakens too.”

Alea had been experimenting with Sian’s spirit for the first semester. Mainly experiments about spirits and spirit mages. To find out the limits of their abilities.

Sian, as if surrendering, raised his hands.

“Hey hey, don’t do that! I keep secrets. I’ll keep my mouth shut, so don’t worry. Just meet one condition of mine. I can even take a mage’s oath here!”

“Swear first. We’ll hear the condition afterward.”

Helmut laid down a ruthlessly unfair condition.

Sian was quick on the uptake. Though pouting, he realized he had to comply in this situation, so he obediently recited the mage’s oath to keep Lampione’s inherited legacy secret.

His condition was this. Grinning, Sian said,

“Let me come check out the inside next time. It’s the dungeon of an archmage after all. It’d be great if you shared the inheritance too, but I don’t think you will.”

Sian was also a mage. He couldn’t help being curious about Lampione’s dungeon.

“I’ll consider it. You’d better watch your mouth. You wouldn’t want to be the first experimented on by Lampione’s magic.”

Alea threw a deadly warning. Sian shrugged.

“Got it.”



H.F.C Chapter 205 (Part 1):
				Although they had been discovered by a troublesome person, there was a silver lining.

Thanks to Sian, both of them gained a heightened sense of vigilance. Just as Sian had secretly followed them, someone else might do the same.

Helmut and Alea had to acknowledge that the people around them were more capable than they had thought.

No matter how well they hid, there were those who could infiltrate in unexpected ways.

Fortunately, Sian only knew that Alea had obtained Lampione’s dungeon; he was unaware of any other facts, not even that Alea was a girl.

The weak vision shared by the dark spirit made it difficult to notice the subtle changes in Alea.

At fifteen, Alea did not yet exhibit distinctly feminine features.

Helmut was left feeling uneasy.

‘For now, it’s been overlooked.’

Sian was quick-witted. Upon entering the dungeon, he immediately realized that Alea had acquired Lampione’s legacy.

Given a few more clues, he might uncover even more. His imagination was indeed rich.

Helmut and Alea still had many secrets. That Alea was a girl. That Helmut was Darien’s disciple. That Helmut possessed the Seed of Darkness, and more.

Given the situation, it wasn’t as if Helmut felt a great friendship towards Sian to share everything.

Telling the truth to Alea alone was more than enough.

‘I need to be more careful.’

The oath of a mage is inescapable, even for a spirit mage.

There was no reason for Sian to risk a penalty and divulge anything about Lampione’s dungeon.

He was someone who cherished himself immensely.

Helmut, just in case, cautioned Sian to keep their secret. Thus, their secret for two became a secret for three, excluding one.

Luckily, Sian completely dispelled any suspicions that Alea was a girl.

It was a prejudice. The cold and rigid Alea could never be a girl, he thought.

‘I might look more feminine in disguise than Alea.’

Realizing the secret, Sian nodded to himself.

‘So they’ve been huddled together over this. No wonder they’re always stuck together.’

Having breached Lampione’s dungeon, there must have been much to talk about.

Though Sian thought it would have been helpful if they included him and Asuka, he had to admit there was no reason to share Lampione’s legacy with them.

He wasn’t resentful, just regretful.

Most of all, the problem was Asuka, not himself. Sian couldn’t trust Asuka’s mouth either.

There had been no chance to test whether Asuka was tight-lipped, and that guy was mindless.

If someone were to interrogate him, he would spill everything easily.

‘Well, Asuka doesn’t have anyone to tell anyway.’

At most, he would tell his mother. Asuka had his secrets too.

Sian reconsidered his assessment of Asuka. Strangely, Asuka was tight-lipped about such matters.

No matter how much Sian tried to coax him or get him drunk to extract information, Asuka wouldn’t budge an inch.

All he learned was that Asuka seemed to have a bad relationship with his father.

‘Still, there can’t be a heavier secret than Lampione’s dungeon.’

He eventually decided to give up uncovering the truth for now, thinking he would find out someday.

Anyway, he firmly resolved to sneak into the dungeon and see it for himself. Sneaking in was his forte.

Thus, the dungeon of the two showed an ominous sign from the start.

As the holidays passed, the dungeon gradually took shape. Alea, who had stocked up on mana stones, immediately started working on it.

An antique tea room reflecting Alea’s tastes appeared, and a marble dining table was set. Various rare teas adorned a display cabinet.

Then Alea’s personal library was established. Separate from the grand library, it was a cozy space designed for concentration.

Helmut had to admit that his training ground was being pushed into the background more and more.

Though Alea said it was necessary to create a training ground, it seemed like the next steps were already planned.

Alea advised him.

“You know, you have the qualifiers coming up soon.”

It was as if she was asking if he had time to worry about the dungeon.

“The qualifiers, right.”

Helmut answered nonchalantly. Now that he thought about it, it was a significant event, but his attention had been completely absorbed by the dungeon.

Or was it just the dungeon? Time flew by when he was with Alea.

‘Maybe I’ve been practicing Darien’s swordsmanship too much lately, I should practice the common swordsmanship techniques too.’

Given the public nature of the tournament, appearing naturally skilled required some proficiency.

Helmut decided to head to the training ground as soon as the holiday was over.

In fact, unless there was something special like a mercenary request, he trained every day without fail.

‘I did beat up that golem, but that’s not enough.’

He had only swung his sword briefly while dealing with the golem. It wasn’t much of a warm-up.

That golem, since there wasn’t much opportunity for actual combat here, seemed like it could be useful.

However, it took time for the golem to recover.

Although Alea could heal it or use mana stones to speed up its recovery, it wasn’t something she could always do.

‘The tournament location will be announced soon.’

It was a trip. Traveling always meant something tumultuous for Helmut. Almost always, some incident occurred.

‘It couldn’t possibly be in Basor.’

If the location turned out to be there, he might have to forfeit. Even though he was in disguise, his presence was too well-known in the martial arts community.

But lately, with the complex political situation in Basol, the possibility of it being chosen was low.

Besides, the Basol people were rough, and there wasn’t even a decent swordsmanship academy there.

‘A trip to a new place.’



H.F.C Chapter 205 (Part 2):
				The human world was vast, and for Helmut, who had been confined in the Forest of Roots, every destination was always new.

The word “travel” sometimes made him feel truly alive.

Early in the morning, Helmut encountered two people in front of the dormitory.

These two were Asuka and Sian, excluding Alea. He had only briefly greeted Alea.

Normally, they would have met early and talked at length, but Alea had stayed up late absorbed in modifying the dungeon and had woken up late.

“Hey, Helmut, aren’t you going out too much? The qualifiers are coming up soon.”

Asuka crossed his arms and asked. He sniffed something suspicious, the so-called smell of secrets.

Helmut, Alea, and even Sian began to sense the subtle shifts among them.

“Are you guys up to something without me?”

Sian calmly shook his head.

“No, why would we be? More importantly, how’s your preparation for the qualifiers? Are you confident?”

“Confident? Of course… I am.”

His voice trailed off to barely a whisper. Asuka glanced at Helmut.

Lately, Asuka had been particularly immersed in training, but Helmut seemed more relaxed.

Seeing him gallivanting around during the holiday, one would think so.

But to him, Helmut felt like a massive mountain. A person could crumble.

Could such a giant mountain like Helmut really be toppled?

‘Whether it works or not, I have to try.’

Asuka gritted his teeth. Indeed, he was not one to give up. That was one aspect Helmut admired about him: his tenacity.

Thus, Asuka’s mind was completely focused on the qualifiers.

Sian quickly succeeded in changing the topic and added the news he had learned.

“They’re announcing the location of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament on the bulletin board at noon today. Aren’t you excited to find out where it will be?”

Asuka asked, his voice teasing.

“And you’re not even from the swordsmanship department, where do you pick up such news?”

“I just happened to run into Instructor Ethan Kudrow on the street and asked him.”

Having visited Kudrow Mansion several times with Helmut, Sian had become quite friendly with Instructor Ethan.

His naturally sociable personality made it easy to build a rapport with the stern and dignified Ethan.

Of all Helmut’s friends, Sian was the most normal and the easiest for Ethan to get along with.

Helmut felt relieved to have such a friend.

Asuka, of course, but Ethan too seemed a bit wary of Alea.

Alea had a certain princess-like quality, making it difficult for others to feel comfortable around her.

“He said to make sure you prepare well for the qualifiers and to visit Kudrow Mansion next weekend.”

Helmut had not visited Kudrow Mansion this holiday because he was with Alea in the dungeon.

Ethan was subtly keen on having regular conversations with Helmut.

It was too obvious to call him out at the academy, so he suggested meeting at the mansion instead. Ethan Kudrow was a good instructor.

“Ah, got it.”

Helmut nodded.

*

As usual, the morning hours passed.

Basic training was always helpful. It not only loosened the body but also improved skills.

In swordsmanship, training is like firewood. You must continuously feed the fire to keep it blazing.

Neglect to add firewood even a little, and the flames will die down.

At noon, Helmut and Asuka headed to the bulletin board side by side.

As soon as class ended, a few curious ones had already rushed outside to the bulletin board. They were eager to be the first to see the notice.

“We’ll find out soon anyway.”

Asuka clicked his tongue in annoyance. Helmut and Asuka slowly reached the bulletin board.

Without even needing to look at the board, they learned where the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament would be held.

The students from the swordsmanship department gathered around the board were already buzzing about it.

The comprehensive swordsmanship tournament was to be held in the capital of the Princedom of Renosa, Britsha. It was a name that sounded unfamiliar.

Helmut recalled his memory of studying history.

The Princedom of Renosa was a nation in the eastern part of the Deus Empire, ruled by the Grand Duke of Renosa, a descendant of the imperial family of the empire.

Although not fully subjugated to the empire, it was significantly influenced and engaged in exchanges with it.

Renosa boasted a strong order of knights and was very wealthy.

The Grand Duke of Renosa, due to his lineage, could potentially aspire to the imperial throne, so the empire either kept Renosa in check or sought to foster close relations with them.

The people of the Grand Ducal family of Renosa received treatment in the empire akin to that of imperial royalty.

The Grand Duke not only participated in the noble assembly of the empire but also exercised powers as a royal.

Everyone chattered excitedly, united in their enthusiasm.

“Isn’t the Princedom of Renosa known for its beautiful landscapes?”

“And it’s also a very wealthy country. They’ll treat the participants extremely well.”

“I’ve heard there are many beautiful women there. Lucky you, Helmut!”

Someone who had spotted Helmut pointed him out and shouted.

Asuka’s face twitched, but even he couldn’t deny that Helmut was the favorite to win.



H.F.C Chapter 206 (Part 1):
				“How do you feel, Helmut? Are you confident? The qualifiers shouldn’t be a problem for you,” Asuka said, looking dissatisfied as he stepped away. Helmut replied lightly.

“If I participate, I have to win.”

He was slightly hesitant about entering the competition, even though Alea was encouraging him. There was the risk of attracting the temple’s attention, and Sian’s antics had made him wary, though Sian himself seemed unconcerned.

Applause erupted around him.

“As expected of Helmut!”

“That’s how a second-year top student in the swordsmanship department should act! Crush them all!”

The second-year swordsmanship students continued their excited conversation.

“If a second-year wins the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, it’ll be incredible, right?”

“Of course, it’ll be amazing. Our year will be on top!”

“The winner will be the best not just in our academy but among all the academies!”

“Obviously. It’s an official acknowledgment. It’ll be so thrilling.”

Undoubtedly, each academy would carefully select only the best to participate, for the sake of honor.

In such a competition, hiding one’s skills or holding back was unthinkable. Those confirmed to participate sharpened their skills to stand out. Proving one’s ability in front of everyone was what being a swordsman was all about. The swordsmanship students were eager to attend the competition for that reason.

Helmut, who had gathered information about Renosa in a short time, listened intently.

The conversation continued.

“Hey, if you win the swordsmanship tournament, by the time you graduate, everyone will line up for you. This time, the scale has grown, so it seems like everyone is paying attention.”

“Could Renosa be interested too? Renosa is known for treating knights well.”

“There are some students from the Principality of Renosa at our academy too, right?”

“I heard from the instructors that students from Renosa generally have the highest grades.”

“I heard that too, across all departments.”

“I heard a rumor that the Grand Duchess of Renosa is attending an academy here in Baden?”

“Really? If she’s royalty from Renosa, she must be very beautiful.”

“I heard from someone from Renosa who she is, but I promised to keep it a secret!”

Wesley boasted teasingly, and was immediately met with jeers from those around him.

“You idiot, then why mention it at all?”

“So, is she beautiful? That’s the important thing.”

“Well, is she or isn’t she? Do I know or not?”

Wesley smiled slyly, the kind of smile that made you want to hit him. The atmosphere around him turned hostile.

Soon, retribution typical of the swordsmanship department ensued. There was no way to avoid it with so many against him.

Wesley soon found himself being choked and screaming, with no one stopping it.

Helmut watched the scene indifferently, but one person suddenly came to his mind.

‘Could it be.’

Helmut shook his head. Things wouldn’t go that smoothly.

Another person crossed Helmut’s mind. Michael, the boy he met in Basor.

He said he was from the empire. To get to the Principality of Renosa, you had to pass through the empire. Could he run into him?

Michael, who couldn’t stand the heat, came all the way to Basor to watch the tournament and recruit talent.

He might be interested in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament. If he wasn’t bedridden after returning from Basor, it wouldn’t be strange for him to show up, even though he wasn’t attending the academy.

‘Will he recognize me?’

The disguise was off. He wouldn’t be acting as Hyde for a while.

Hyde, with his blonde hair and blue eyes, had a different impression from Helmut. Helmut’s black hair and black eyes were much more intimidating.

But Helmut was willing to bet that Michael would recognize him. Maybe not all his fortune, but a significant part of it.

Michael was an exceptionally perceptive and intelligent boy, even more so than Sian. And he was a unique type that Helmut remembered vividly.

‘Michael….’

Although there were some things that bothered him, it wasn’t a bad feeling.

Michael’s offer to make Helmut his own was still in question, but Michael had promised another meeting.

Helmut felt it wouldn’t be a distant future.

Anyway, the qualifiers were just around the corner.



H.F.C Chapter 206 (Part 2):
				The next day, Helmut was leaving the training ground when he happened to run into Charlotte.

“Hello.”

She was drenched in sweat, probably just finishing her training.

Unlike a lady of noble status, she was dressed plainly.

Charlotte had been putting more effort into her training than other students recently. Her desire to participate in the selection was stronger than anyone else’s.

She had taken the top spot among the first-year swordsmanship students, but the gap with the runner-up wasn’t significant. She needed to keep improving to maintain her position.

“Is your training going well?”

Helmut asked. Charlotte flinched and looked at him.

Helmut wasn’t the type to ask about someone’s well-being. He was more indifferent than just taciturn. Charlotte’s assessment was accurate.

However, to Helmut, Charlotte held a special meaning. Not in the same way as Alea, but still significant. That’s why he noticed her.

“I’m working hard. I want to pass the qualifiers too.”

“I see.”

Helmut nodded and passed by her. He had nothing more to say.

Just then, Charlotte called him.

“Senior.”

Helmut slowly turned around. Charlotte’s eyes were serious.

“I thought I should tell you, since you’ll find out anyway.”

Helmut looked at her curiously. Hesitant at first, Charlotte soon spoke with a determined expression.

“The person you mentioned before, that person is also in Renosa. If you go to Renosa as a representative of Greta Academy, you’ll have a chance to meet them.”

A sudden shock surged through his mind. His body felt frozen. It took Helmut a moment to respond.

“…You.”

“I’m from Renosa too. I want to go to Renosa by passing the qualifiers….”

Charlotte trailed off, looking down at her hands.

The swordsmanship tournament would continue until the start of the vacation. If she was going to Renosa anyway, it would be better to go as a representative of Greta Academy rather than just as a spectator.

Charlotte’s enthusiasm was understandable. More importantly, she had someone she wanted to show her achievements to.

To meet that person with her head held high, she had to pass the qualifiers.

“Well, that’s all.”

Charlotte bowed her head and walked away. Helmut watched her silently for a while.

His heart pounded. So quickly, the goal was in sight. An endless tension gripped his throat.

‘Margret Irene.’

His mother’s name. A vague emotion that was hard to label as longing.

Finding her was as natural as a salmon swimming upstream. That naturalness was absolute. Just like he had to leave the Forest of Roots.

But it was all too smooth. It made him suspicious, as if someone had orchestrated it to happen this way.

Surprisingly, Helmut realized he wasn’t mentally prepared.

Even though emotions were a dull thing for him.

An inexplicable chill ran down his spine. It was surprisingly similar to fear.

Helmut gritted his teeth.

‘First, the qualifiers.’

Securing his spot as a representative of Greta Academy in the comprehensive swordsmanship competition was the priority.

Helmut steadied himself.

The shock of Charlotte’s words hadn’t worn off.

Helmut spent the entire day in a daze, not even noticing the students around him whispering about him.

He swung his wooden sword like a man possessed.

Asuka also noticed something strange. He looked suspiciously at the second-year swordsmanship students.

“What’s going on? What did you do? Why are they acting like that?”

The answer soon became clear. At lunchtime, while Helmut was sitting in the student cafeteria, he heard an outrageous story.

One of the swordsmanship students, who had gathered around him, bluntly asked a question. They had been gossiping among themselves and couldn’t resist asking the source.

“Helmut, can I ask you something? What do you think of Charlotte?”

“What do you mean, what do I think?”

The question was so out of the blue that Helmut’s response was delayed.

“Come on, Helmut. Don’t dodge the question. Are you interested in Charlotte? You didn’t seem that keen on that pretty senior.”

Someone helpfully reminded him.

“Senior Teresa.”

“Yeah, did you dislike Senior Teresa because of Charlotte? What about your girlfriend? You’re a sly one.”

“Did you break up already? That could happen. Charlotte is pretty. And diligent. Her manner of speech is a bit stiff, but she has a cute side too.”

“Isn’t she your type?”

“No way! Anyway, Helmut, just answer. Everyone’s curious.”

Helmut was the top student in the second-year swordsmanship department. Although he often forgot it, everyone paid attention to him.

Because he was so unresponsive and indifferent, even trivial matters involving him became significant.

“I…”

Helmut was about to say he wasn’t interested, but he stopped because he couldn’t completely deny his interest. Instead, he said something else.

“Why is there such a rumor?”

“They said you were staring at Charlotte’s back longingly in front of the training ground?”

“And you asked about her well-being? That’s why there’s a rumor in the swordsmanship department that you’re interested in Charlotte!”

“Hey, you spread the rumor yourself.”

“The rumor was already out before I spread it! By now, the other departments probably know too!”

‘What is this nonsense?’

Helmut raised an eyebrow. He had met Charlotte in the morning. Only a few hours had passed.

How could a rumor spread so quickly? He wasn’t as famous as Alea, was he?

Helmut decided to deny it.

“That’s not true.”

“Oh, come on. You’re not the type to ask about someone’s well-being.”

“Right, why is Charlotte an exception?”

They were right. Helmut wasn’t the type to ask about anyone’s well-being.

“Even I don’t get asked how I’m doing,” Asuka said, looking suspiciously at Helmut with crossed arms. His gaze was sharp.

“Really, it’s not like that. I was just impressed by something Charlotte said.”

Helmut had to firmly deny it repeatedly. Even though he couldn’t reveal the conversation, it was difficult to dispel their doubts.

“What did she say?”

“Was it about Renosa? Now that I think about it, I heard Charlotte is from Renosa too.”

Wesley, who was about to say something, quickly clamped his mouth shut.

Fortunately, no one noticed his reaction. They were all focused on Helmut.

“I can’t say.”

Helmut answered the rest of their questions with silence.

The students trying to pry information from him eventually had to give up and leave, grumbling, unable to break through Helmut’s wall of silence.

But the suspicious glances didn’t disappear.



H.F.C Chapter 207 (Part 1):
				It seemed that the swordsmanship department had wrapped things up for now, but it wasn’t over.

Back in the dormitory, Helmut faced the same question from Sian.

“Hey, Helmut. What’s going on between you and Charlotte?”

His eyes were filled with curiosity. Helmut was starting to get tired of this question.

Asuka, who had been looking a bit off since earlier, suddenly kicked the ground.

“I’m heading in first.”

After he curtly said that and disappeared, Sian hummed.

“Is it a love triangle?”

“It’s not like that.”

Helmut cut him off firmly. Maybe Asuka was interested in Charlotte.

As far as he knew, Asuka never really talked about Charlotte or tried to speak to her.

While the swordsmanship department students would chatter about Charlotte, Asuka never joined in.

Sian smirked and added, “You’re too conspicuous. Especially now that the qualifiers are approaching. Your stories have even reached the magic department.”

“The magic department?”

Helmut furrowed his brow as he chewed on those words.

Alea was surprisingly well-informed about rumors. She might have heard something.

Helmut had told Alea he was looking for his parents, but he hadn’t mentioned Charlotte. That she might be related by blood.

That was just speculation.

‘It doesn’t matter.’

Alea had been engrossed in the dungeon recently and probably wouldn’t care about such trivial matters.

Helmut didn’t feel the need to explain it.

She would understand it was a misunderstanding. He had already told her that Charlotte was just a junior.

However, that night, Alea seemed strangely cold when they met at his door.

Her face was cold, and her responses were terse.

Helmut unconsciously asked if something bad had happened today.

Alea smiled slightly. It was a chilling smile.

“A very bad thing indeed.”

Then she asked,

“Don’t you have something to tell me?”

“Something to tell you?”

Alea knew about Helmut. She was sharp and observant but could be incredibly dense in some ways.

The gap was so large that sometimes he needed to speak plainly.

“Yeah, like the rumor that you’re interested in some junior girl?”

‘She was concerned.’

Helmut briefly denied it.

“You know it’s a misunderstanding.”

Alea crossed her arms.

“A misunderstanding? How would I know? You didn’t say anything.”

Helmut thought she would understand even if he didn’t say it, but he didn’t realize that some things need to be spoken out loud.

Thinking she was just angry, he denied it again.

“…It’s a misunderstanding.”

“Do I have to ask every little detail to know if it’s a misunderstanding or not?”

“We talked, I looked at her, and that’s how the rumor started.”

Helmut felt that Alea was sharp today.

Shouldn’t it end if it’s a misunderstanding? He started feeling a bit down. Didn’t she trust him? What about all the secrets they shared?

Helmut didn’t understand that trust and feelings could be separate. He had never faced such a situation.

“The reason doesn’t matter. The rumor is out there, and I find it unpleasant.”

“Even if it’s not true?”

“Even if it’s not true. Everyone will think there’s something between you and Charlotte.”

Charlotte herself would likely make a serious face over such rumors.

Helmut sighed lightly.

“What do you want me to do?”

So he understood why Alea was upset. He didn’t know how to fix it, though.

“They say you were the one who approached her first?”

“She greeted me.”

“Just because she greeted you? You don’t do that to anyone else. Why is she different?”

Suspicion filled Alea’s eyes. Fortunately, she was the type who didn’t have much patience for letting her imagination run wild.

She was the type to directly ask for an answer.

Helmut, who wasn’t good at guessing people’s feelings, found this easier.

“Charlotte is related to me by blood… probably.”

A sister or cousin, something like that. Alea looked shocked.



H.F.C Chapter 207 (Part 2):
				“What? What do you mean? I’ve seen her… well, she does look like you.”

Thinking hard about Charlotte’s appearance, Alea had to admit it.

“Remember when I told you about the pendant? She knew my mother’s name. She didn’t answer definitively, though.”

“You felt like she was close to your mother?”

“Yes.”

“Then you should have told me that.”

Alea’s eyes widened in protest. Helmut shook his head.

“I wasn’t sure.”

There are facts you can’t carelessly speak about unless you’re certain. Anything concerning his mother was like that.

Alea lowered her voice and asked,

“Then you can find out where your mother is. Why haven’t you gone to see her?”

“…Not yet.”

It was a hesitation mixed with many things. Alea understood his answer.

Her expression softened compared to earlier, and she muttered,

“Still, I don’t like it. Others don’t know.”

“You mean I shouldn’t talk to her?”

Although Helmut generally didn’t care, he thought that was a bit much.

“A greeting is fine. Just don’t act in a way that causes misunderstandings. Got it?”

Alea warned with a sly look. Avoiding misunderstandings? That was difficult.

How could he avoid misunderstandings just by looking at someone?

But Helmut didn’t argue.

“Okay.”

Anyway, it wasn’t hard for Helmut.

Talking to Charlotte like this had been an exception. He usually didn’t talk to anyone.

“So, what did you talk about with her?”

“Charlotte told me my mother might be in the Principality of Renosa.”

He had been thinking of telling her this. Alea’s face showed surprise.

“That’s…”

“When the swordsmanship tournament starts, I will go to Renosa and meet my mother.”

A heavy feeling came over him. Like a rock weighing down on his shoulders.

He had been waiting for this his whole life. But as it approached, it wasn’t light or entirely welcome. It felt like being caught in the current of fate.

“Should I do some investigation?”

“No.”

It seemed better not to know in advance. Alea realized this and said,

“Then I won’t see you for a while.”

“Probably. I thought you were more interested in the dungeon than me.”

Alea made a guilty face at his comment.

“It’s not entirely like that.”

“You can focus on the dungeon. With peace of mind.”

Helmut didn’t know it, but he had some resentment about it.

“It’s not like that. I’m also considering your training ground. I’ll try to have it ready before the vacation.”

Alea scratched her cheek.

“You can contact me with the first bracelet I gave you. I’ll upgrade it before you leave.”

Alea returned to her usual self, as if she hadn’t been angry.

“During the vacation… I might go to Renosa too, if you’re staying there.”

She was calculating the time. One of Heike’s conditions was that Alea spend part of her vacation with him.

But now Alea had Lampione’s legacy. Even if her willful, self-centered mentor would consider that and might adjust the schedule.

Heike was aware of Alea and Helmut’s relationship. Spending part of the vacation with him would be acceptable.

“Well, it will be after the swordsmanship tournament.”

Alea put her hand on Helmut’s shoulder encouragingly.

“Do well in the qualifiers. It starts tomorrow, right?”

Helmut quietly placed his hand over hers. Hoping this strange feeling would subside.

*

The day of the qualifiers dawned. It was essentially a final exam, so even the talkative second-year swordsmanship students were quiet today.

Excuses like not feeling well wouldn’t work. Managing your condition was part of your skill.

First, the second-year students competed. The top-ranked ones would then face the top first and third-year students to select two final representatives from each year.

The qualifiers were like a preliminary for the tournament, so its format was similar. There was even a consolation match for the losers.

The round of qualifiers, which involved the top-ranked students, was held publicly in the academy’s affiliated arena, in front of spectators.

External spectators were allowed, so the audience was mainly citizens of Baden or those interested in seeing the swordsmanship department’s skills.

The announcement had been up for a while, and many were interested.

The tension on stage was incomparable to dueling in front of classmates or instructors.

Failing to show your skills under this pressure was also part of your ability.

The qualifiers were smooth sailing.

Helmut had fought stronger opponents on bigger stages. Winning back then hadn’t been hard, and it wouldn’t be hard against second-year academy students.

For Helmut, the word ‘condition’ was almost meaningless. He was used to fighting in peak conditions.

Unlike regular dueling, the qualifiers were closer to a real tournament. Real swords were used.

Helmut didn’t need to hold back and give opponents time to demonstrate their abilities like in duels.

“Helmut, victory!”

Hearing his own name declared in victory was exhilarating, even if this stage was insignificant compared to the martial arts tournament in Basor.

Helmut ended the match with a single strike. There was no need to swing twice.

Facing a real sword at their throat, his opponent froze, unable to block or dodge. It was an incredibly fast sword.

‘Too weak.’

Helmut thought calmly. His classmates should be somewhat on the same level.

But the gap grew daily. As if they were born different.

His classmates were herbivores, and he was a predator. Just as a rabbit couldn’t become stronger than a weak tiger, the gap between them was that significant.

‘Maybe someone like Asuka would be different.’

Helmut hoped. The result wouldn’t change, but at least it wouldn’t end in a single strike.

But he didn’t encounter Asuka until he reached the second round.

The draw separated the first and second rankers.

This wasn’t about choosing a winner, but filtering the top participants for the second round.

As expected, Asuka also advanced to the second round after Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 208 (Part 1):
				“Have all the kids been slacking off? Why are their skills like this?”

Asuka boasted confidently. He, too, finished most of his matches within a minute.

Asuka felt that the gap between himself and the other students had widened even more than before.

Since meeting Helmut, Asuka had been relentlessly training. His rate of improvement was astonishing.

When talent is combined with hard work, it’s like adding wings.

Asuka, too, was slowly outgrowing the academy level. If not for Helmut, he would have easily monopolized all the attention.

‘The representatives will be either me or Asuka.’

Helmut judged that to be a certainty, no matter how much effort others put in.

Although two representatives were to be selected across the first, second, and third years, both of them would come from the second year. Helmut and Asuka.

Asuka grinned and said,

“The kids from the Principality of Renosa must be disappointed. It’s a chance to compete in their home country. Just bad luck.”

At that moment, a figure flashed in Helmut’s mind. Charlotte.

“They say they’ll pick an additional reserve. If she makes it, who knows.”

“Yeah.”

Helmut replied briefly. If she performed well, she might make it as a reserve.

In Renosa, he would also find out the truth about his relationship with Charlotte.

At the venue of the second qualifier round, Helmut and Asuka encountered Charlotte.

Her face hardened as soon as she saw them. It seemed she had heard about the ‘rumors’ as well.

Charlotte, who mingled freely with her peers, would have been more plagued by rumors than Helmut. Everyone must have asked her about it at least once.

But since they had met face-to-face, they couldn’t pretend not to know each other.

She greeted them politely.

“Hello.”

“What? You too? Are there so few people in the first year?”

Asuka acknowledged Charlotte’s skills to some extent. But even as he recognized her, he spoke with a smirk.

Charlotte replied confidently,

“I’m the top student in the first-year swordsmanship department.”

“As if the spot will go down to the first years. Isn’t it a waste of time?”

While the surrounding first-year students flared up, Charlotte remained unperturbed. She wanted to go to Renosa more than anyone.

“You never know until you try.”

“Sure, sure. Well, good luck!”

“Yes, senior.”

Despite Asuka’s sarcastic tone, Charlotte showed no reaction.

Watching them, Helmut realized for the first time that Asuka had initiated a conversation with Charlotte.

Even if it was in a provoking manner, it was a surprisingly mild exchange for Asuka.

Asuka himself didn’t realize this, but Sian’s talk of a love triangle wasn’t entirely baseless.

Asuka, interpreting Helmut’s gaze, pointed a finger at him.

“Don’t be so confident. You never know the outcome.”

“Sure.”

Helmut responded indifferently. Unless he went into hibernation for about ten years, the gap between Asuka and Helmut was that significant.

Soon, Instructor Patricia appeared and announced to them,

“Everyone, compete fairly. Those selected will represent Greta Academy, so keep that in mind.”

Her glance at Asuka seemed to be a preemptive warning.

Instructors were objective. They already knew who would be the representatives.

Asuka snorted arrogantly, not understanding why he always got reprimanded.

Sighing inwardly, Instructor Patricia declared,

“Now, let the second qualifier round begin!”

The second qualifier round would span two days, including a loser’s bracket, to ultimately select two representatives.

Since the goal was the qualifiers, there were no additional awards even for high rankings or being chosen as a representative.

“Helmut! Step onto the stage.”

After a brief wait in the waiting room, it was Helmut’s turn. He glanced around as he stepped onto the stage.

The academy’s affiliated arena was more than half full. The atmosphere was charged with excitement.

Some students’ families from nearby Baden seemed to have come to cheer.

For a moment, he thought of Basor. Though there were no blazing sun or excited crowds here, and no opponents to match his skills, it was still a competition.

‘I guess I did enjoy the martial arts tournaments.’

When he thought of martial arts tournaments, he thought of him. The one who always cheered for him in the arena.

Helmut looked around for Michael. The boy with the bright blonde hair that stood out even at a glance.

But he couldn’t find him.



H.F.C Chapter 208 (Part 2):
				‘Good.’

No matter how well-informed Michael was, he wouldn’t come all the way to Greta Academy for what could barely be called a competition.

As Michael said, he wasn’t just playing around.

Helmut’s first opponent was a third-year student. The top student in the third-year swordsmanship department, no less.

Seeing that they had matched the top students from the second and third years from the beginning, it seemed the second qualifier round was randomly assigned. Just like a real tournament.

The opponent looked slightly nervous but had confident eyes. It was said that the top third-year student was significantly better than the runner-up. A typical honor student.

‘Even if he loses to me, he’ll probably make it through the loser’s bracket anyway.’

Helmut thought lightly.

“I hear you’re the top student in the second year? I’ve heard your name. Let’s see if you’re as great as the rumors say.”

The opponent narrowed his eyes skeptically. Helmut nodded.

“By all means.”

And in the match that soon began, the top third-year student avoided Helmut’s first strike but had to kneel at the second.

‘Better than the second-year students. Maybe I could’ve ended it in one strike if I adjusted the angle a bit more?’

There was room for contemplation. Glancing at his pale opponent, Helmut turned around.

To have reached the top at Greta Academy, he must have had considerable pride in his talent.

The shock was immense for someone encountering something so unfamiliar. But it wasn’t Helmut’s concern.

As Helmut walked away with his victory, the third-year students’ gazes changed.

The indifferent or wary looks turned into astonishment.

“What, it’s over already? They said your opponent was the top third-year student.”

Asuka, who was waiting, asked. Helmut simply nodded.

“Alright, I’ll finish quickly too.”

Asuka seemed determined, feeling a sense of competition. His opponents were clearly no challenge for him either.

*

The second qualifier round proceeded quickly. There weren’t many participants to begin with.

Helmut and Asuka, being far from the loser’s bracket, finished the first day’s schedule quickly.

Helmut finished without much effort, and Asuka, too, ended without difficulty.

On the second day, the final representatives would be selected.

After the qualifier round, they would have some free time until they left for the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Asuka, waiting for his turn, muttered suddenly.

“Wouldn’t it be better to have an integrated qualifier round for all grades?”

Even if the qualifier round was integrated, Helmut and Asuka would still each take a spot as representatives. That’s what he meant.

Helmut pointed out simply.

“If they did that, the higher grades would monopolize all the roster spots. That wouldn’t be good in terms of inter-academy exchange.”

“Oh, I see.”

Asuka seemed uninterested.

Thinking about it now, he realized that leaving for another region for a swordsmanship tournament and living collectively with others didn’t suit him.

‘It’s annoying.’

Most of all, participating in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament might reveal things about him. Asuka didn’t like that idea.

Being tied down to academy life, representing Greta Academy, was not appealing.

Even a crazy dog like Asuka couldn’t run wild anywhere else. He had been quiet lately, but other academies wouldn’t look kindly on a commoner like him.

With the qualifier match nearly decided, various thoughts crossed his mind.

Asuka shook his head.

‘Still, I must win the qualifier match.’

It was a matter of pride. And Asuka achieved what he wanted.

“Asuka, victory!”

Charlotte looked down at her fallen sword, a glint of regret and disappointment in her eyes.

In the last match of the second qualifier round, her opponent was Asuka.

Charlotte, with her tenacious and adaptive swordsmanship, had fought her way up from the loser’s bracket, even defeating the top third-year student.

Despite her significant improvement, it was an enormous achievement.

That the top third-year student had lost to Helmut in just two strikes had left him in shock.

Asuka extended a hand expressionlessly.

“Get up.”

As she grabbed his hand and stood, regret showed on Charlotte’s face.

‘Is this the end…?’

She had done her best but failed to secure a spot as a representative to Renosa. Seeing her expression, Asuka asked,

“You really wanted to go to Renosa, huh?”

“Yes, I did. I’m from Renosa too.”

Asuka’s eyes widened.

“You’re from Renosa?”

“I thought you knew, considering you’re his friend… Was I wrong?”

“That guy isn’t kind enough to share such things. Well, anyway, you did well.”

Asuka spat the words somewhat displeased and turned away.

But he was lost in thought for a while.

*

After the qualifiers ended, Instructor Alan called them over.

“Both of you did well. As expected, you performed excellently.”

“You knew we’d be selected, Instructor?”

Asuka asked provocatively, and Instructor Alan nodded.

“All the instructors predicted the same. We’ve been watching you. Anyway, let me briefly explain the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament again. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.”

But as his explanation continued, Asuka frowned.

“What? The tournament continues until the vacation?”

He scratched the back of his head, looking troubled.

“I can’t do that. I have places to go during the vacation.”

He had places to go, but more than that, he hated being tied down to academy life for the tournament during the vacation.

Helmut would be too busy training his swordsmanship to interact with him much.

‘It’s going to be extremely boring.’

Various reasons emerged for why he didn’t want to go. Instructor Alan tried to persuade him.

“Asuka, it’s a chance to make your name known as a representative of Greta Academy. For a commoner like you, it’s an excellent opportunity. You’ll gain honor through your performance in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.”

Asuka had enrolled as a commoner. Because of this, other details about him were unknown even to Greta Academy.

Asuka had thoroughly hidden his background. His wild behavior made it hard to believe he wasn’t a commoner.

Asuka snorted.

“I don’t need honor. My skill is my honor.”

There was already someone who endlessly talked about honor and status every vacation, and he was sick of it.



H.F.C Chapter 209 (Part 1):
				Instructor Alan frowned.

“So, are you saying you don’t want to participate in the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament? I think it would be a waste of your skill if you don’t participate.”

His words were sincere, but on the other hand, it was also a relief.

If Asuka decided to step back on his own, Instructor Alan had no objections.

Asuka was more than skilled enough to represent Greta Academy, but he posed problems in other ways.

A separate meeting was planned to discuss those issues, under a topic like ‘Measures to Restrain Asuka.’

“Well, yeah. Even after thinking it over, I can’t do it. I can’t spend my golden vacation in a place like that, no matter how scenic Renosa is.”

Asuka casually dismissed the opportunity that almost everyone in the swordsmanship department coveted.

Unless it was for tourism, he had no interest. Besides, Asuka had no desire to compete against students from other academies.

This wouldn’t be the last Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament, and there would be another chance next year. He had calculated this in his mind.

‘It’s better for someone who wants to go to go. Based on merit, that one will probably end up third.’

If he gave up, the opportunity would naturally go to the third-placer.

Since Charlotte was from Renosa, she would have to go to Renosa anyway.

“Fine, if that’s the case, there’s nothing we can do.”

Instructor Alan nodded. There would be no need for another round, just an announcement to Charlotte.

“Any more questions?”

When they both answered no, Instructor Alan told them to rest and readily turned his back.

As Asuka watched his retreating figure, a sudden thought struck him.

‘Wait, that means Helmut and Charlotte will be going together!’

For some reason, he didn’t like it. Asuka glared at Helmut, realizing how strange he was being.

Why would it bother him whether those two were together or not?

‘What does it have to do with me?’

Asuka changed his mind. It was silly for him to be concerned.

After all, Helmut had a girl who came with him during that festival.

But Asuka couldn’t let it go and asked,

“Helmut, you’re not interested in Charlotte, are you? I mean, do you like her?”

“I already told you I don’t.”

“Yeah, I figured.”

Asuka nodded. But soon he asked again, seemingly doubtful.

“Well, what if you end up developing an interest in her from being around her?”

Helmut cut off Asuka’s probing words without hesitation.

“There’s no reason for us to be around each other.”

While there might be some conversation, Charlotte was also mindful of rumors. There wouldn’t be many opportunities to get close.

All the selected participants would travel to Renosa for the tournament. Just because they were selected together didn’t mean they had to act together. They would be separated due to accommodations.

There were few girls in the swordsmanship department at Greta Academy, but Instructor Patricia was also expected to accompany them to Renosa.

‘Why is he so persistent?’

Helmut stared at Asuka. Feeling Helmut’s gaze, Asuka explained defensively,

“No, I was just worried you might develop feelings for Charlotte and bother her. She seemed uncomfortable with the rumors.”

Helmut cut him off sharply.

“Unnecessary worry.”

“Fine then!”

The way he waved his hand and turned his back seemed unusual. As if something had struck a nerve.

‘I suppose so.’

In any case, it didn’t matter to Helmut whether Asuka went or not. In fact, it was better this way.

Like before he got along with Sian, Asuka would try to cling to him, and whenever Helmut tried to do something, he would grumble about him wandering off alone.

That could get annoying, so it was more freeing to go alone.

Even if Asuka had feelings for Charlotte, it wasn’t his concern.

Thus, Helmut and Charlotte were chosen to represent the first, second, and third years of the swordsmanship department at Greta Academy.

Everyone at Greta Academy, including the instructors, felt relieved that Asuka wouldn’t participate.

They couldn’t predict what kind of trouble he might cause at the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.

Only one person was suspicious about the whole situation—Charlotte, who was going to Renosa.

She approached Asuka and asked,

“Is it because of me?”

“What are you talking about?”

Asuka frowned, aware of the gazes from the swordsmanship department students watching from a distance.

Charlotte, true to her straightforward nature, asked directly,

“If you’re giving up because I’m from Renosa…”

“What nonsense. Do you think I’d care about something like that?”

Asuka responded aggressively.

“I just don’t want to go. I have things to do during vacation too.”

By saying this, no one would suspect any other intentions.

Charlotte seemed to accept his words as she raised her eyebrows.

“Won’t you regret giving up such an opportunity?”

“It’s a great opportunity for you, but not for me. There’s always next year. Missing it once isn’t a big deal.”

Asuka spoke confidently. No matter how hard the first, second, and third-year students tried, they wouldn’t reach his level by next year.

Charlotte, still doubtful, said,

“If that’s the case, then good.”

Asuka seemed annoyed.

“Don’t misunderstand, I’m not one of your followers from the swordsmanship department!”

Charlotte was highly popular not only among first-years but the entire swordsmanship department.

She was a rare female student, skilled, and had a gentle personality. She was an unusual type.

Because of this, she had a following, and being treated as one of them hurt Asuka’s pride.

“I never thought that. Understood.”

Charlotte bowed and turned away. Asuka scratched his head as he watched her go.

He felt he had overreacted, but couldn’t pinpoint why.



H.F.C Chapter 209 (Part 2):
				“Geez, so annoying.”

That ignorance brought a feeling of vexation to Asuka.

He kicked a stray stone on the ground and left the place.

The students who saw him do that tilted their heads in confusion.

“At least Asuka doesn’t hit girls.”

“He’s been quiet lately, really mellowed out.”

“Charlotte is brave, talking to a mad dog like him.”

“Judging by his reaction, seems like there was some sort of fight.”

“Do you think Charlotte would pick a fight? With his temper, he’s just making a fuss on his own.”

This time, there were no misunderstandings like with Helmut.

At least, it seemed Asuka’s intentions had been successfully conveyed.

*

A few days later, Charlotte heard someone call her name in front of the dormitory. It was an unfamiliar man.

“You must be Miss Charlotte.”

“That’s right.”

“Here.”

The moment she received the letter sealed with her family’s crest, Charlotte quickly hid it in her bosom, glancing around.

“Very well.”

The man who nodded and left didn’t seem to be from her family, just a mere errand runner.

As soon as Charlotte returned to her room, she took out the letter.

“Why would a letter come from Renosa, and in such an overt manner?”

When she opened it, her eyes widened.

She had expected it to be from her mother, but it was from an entirely unexpected person.

[To my beloved sister, the esteemed Charlotte.]

The moment she read the opening line, Charlotte pursed her lips in shock. But she wasn’t flustered, for this was just how Michael was.

‘Capricious and self-centered as always.’

That was the evaluation only Charlotte had of Michael, who easily won people’s favor with his charm.

The opening greetings written in smooth, affectionate words could almost be mistaken for a letter to a lover.

Whether Michael was being malicious or if his affection for his sister was suddenly welling up, Charlotte couldn’t tell.

Even though she thought Michael disliked her, sometimes she was confused.

Being fraternal twins, Michael was close yet distant to Charlotte.

Everyone was under the illusion that Michael thought specially of her, but Michael readily gave Charlotte the impression that he disliked her.

He mocked and teased her without hesitation.

Charlotte didn’t think it was because she was his only sister whom he felt comfortable with.

Michael felt inferior to Charlotte.

Her healthy body, her talent for the sword. Because she was born with the two things he didn’t have.

Charlotte understood his inferiority complex and yielded many things to Michael.

She had tried to improve their relationship, but it hadn’t worked out.

Michael showed a side to her that he didn’t show to anyone else.

He also monopolized their mother’s love using his weak body as an excuse.

It was only around the time Charlotte entered the academy that she realized it stemmed not just from an inferiority complex, but could be his way of keeping other potential heirs of the family in check.

Michael hated losing what was his and enjoyed taking or possessing others’ things.

Although hidden by his angelic appearance, he was very greedy and competitive.

Charlotte didn’t want the heir’s position. However…

‘If Michael doesn’t consider me his sister, there’s nothing I can do.’

At some point, Charlotte gave up on Michael. But she couldn’t help feeling hopeful at times.

Michael had a very strong, almost magical charm that drew people in.

Even as his sister, Charlotte wasn’t an exception.

Charlotte closed her eyes for a moment and then continued reading Michael’s letter.

He said he heard through his sources at Greta Academy that Charlotte was selected to represent the swordsmanship department.

The news must have reached him through the faculty, since Charlotte was from Renosa.

He congratulated her on achieving such a remarkable feat as a first-year and added that he regretted not seeing her last vacation.

‘I look forward to seeing you in Renosa.’

It was unclear whether Michael truly anticipated it, or if his heart had changed while Charlotte was away at the academy.

It could also be another trick to raise her hopes and crush them. Michael had a cruel side.

Like a child tearing off a butterfly’s wings.

“…Michael.”

Charlotte stared at her brother’s letter with complex emotions.

She wanted to return to Renosa as Greta Academy’s representative, as if to show him.

But now that it was happening, she felt uneasy. She pondered over it.

For now, all she could do was do her best for Greta Academy, having taken the opportunity Asuka gave up.

She put the letter down and decided to head to the training ground immediately.



H.F.C Chapter 210 (Part 1): The Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.
				The final qualifiers for Greta Academy proceeded smoothly.

A total of four candidates were chosen for the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Helmut and Charlotte, along with the other two candidates, were selected from the fourth and sixth years respectively.

Leon from the fourth year and Nils from the sixth year.

These qualifiers were made strictly according to the classification criteria of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, with lower years competing against each other and higher years doing the same.

This fact was once again announced by the instructor at a gathering of the four selected participants.

“Nils and Leon, Helmut and Charlotte will be in the same category. The match schedule will be arranged so they don’t face each other in the first round, but as they progress to higher stages, they might end up competing against each other, even if they are from the same academy. Think of each other as competitors, not comrades.”

Instructor Patricia explained clearly.

Charlotte glanced at Helmut. He was the senior who knew her mother’s maiden name. She realized belatedly that even their appearances were somewhat similar.

Helmut and Charlotte, both in the lower years, might face each other early on if they were unlucky.

For Helmut, it wouldn’t be a bad thing at all, but for Charlotte, it would be extremely unfortunate.

Helmut was a strong contender to win this tournament.

Charlotte knew this subconsciously.

But she didn’t ask to be spared from facing Helmut. Instead, she steeled her resolve.

‘Even if my opponent is Senior Helmut, I won’t just give in easily.’
