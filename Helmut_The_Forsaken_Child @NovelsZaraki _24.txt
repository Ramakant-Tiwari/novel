The reason Michael went to Basor was to provide guidance on organizing a comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Basor’s martial arts tournaments were known for their tradition and history.

Among the numerous talents at the academy, Charlotte’s talent wasn’t outstanding, but it was quite noticeable.

It was a talent that could generally be called genius-level.

Considering she was a girl at a physical disadvantage, her talent stood out even more.

On top of that, she added effort. Charlotte prided herself on her diligence, unmatched by anyone.

The tournament was held in Renosa. It was a chance to show her accomplishments in front of her parents.

Charlotte hoped that this would draw her mother’s attention to her, to see what she had achieved at Greta Academy.

No matter how tough the opponent, she couldn’t afford to give up easily.

‘Even if realistically it might be difficult.’

Helmut sensed her lingering gaze on him for a moment. Charlotte’s existence felt strangely vivid.

As if his blood was stirring and instinctively provoked somehow.

Helmut rarely took notice of others’ presence. But there was something about Charlotte. That feeling grew stronger.

Helmut thought it was because of their bloodline. Perhaps a distant relative or cousin… or even a younger sibling.

He couldn’t guess beyond that.

His relationship with Charlotte would be defined after visiting Renosa and meeting his mother.

His heart throbbed slightly. Helmut was probably sent to the Forest of Roots from Renosa. The place where he was born and his life was erased.

‘If I go to Renosa, will I remember anything from when I was a newborn baby, the air, the sounds?’

The Seed of Darkness awakened his instincts. The name Renosa didn’t sound familiar.

But Helmut knew that if that was where he was born, he would feel something the moment he set foot on that land.

His heart raced, with a different kind of tension from the swordsmanship tournament.

Instructor Patricia looked at the four selected participants, almost expressionless.

“Charlotte is just a first-year, so I can’t expect much from her… but since she’s from Renosa, she might do well in a familiar environment.”

It would be rare for a first-year to be selected, even in other academies. The pride of the third and fifth-year swordsmanship students who weren’t selected was naturally hurt.

Especially for lower years. A first-year was selected while a third-year was not!

On the other hand, the first and second years were more enthusiastic. In fact, two candidates were effectively chosen from the second year. Asuka declined the opportunity, but still.

However, it was also true that Charlotte was in a position to seize that opportunity. She was third in line.

‘How curious.’

Instructor Patricia looked at the four alternately.

Nils, reaching graduation, had the bearing of a robust swordsman and occupied the most space in the view.

But the most noticeable among them was, indeed, Helmut.

Cold black eyes and black hair. Even Instructor Patricia sometimes felt an overwhelming presence from him.

A boy with a well of unknown depth in his skills.

If Instructor Patricia had to name one potential champion among these four, she could confidently say it would be Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 210 (Part 2): The Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.
				The virtue of a swordsman is silence, it is said, but even a chatterbox is fine if they have the skills.

But the four here were quite silent, as if they had planned it.

‘Better than being talkative. I’m relieved that Asuka isn’t here.’

Instructor Patricia nodded.

“We will depart for Renosa in a week. Until then, prepare your bodies and minds.”

“Yes!”

With the instructor’s words, they all left the assembly area.

Nils left first, then Charlotte bowed her head politely to her seniors.

“Well then.”

Helmut also turned to leave, but a voice from behind stopped him in his tracks.

“Wait, you there.”

Helmut turned around.

“Are you that guy who is friends with Alea?”

Leon, the fourth-year senior, gestured towards Helmut with his arms crossed.

Arrogance exuded from the noble-looking Leon. It wasn’t because Helmut was a commoner, but more of his general demeanor.

He was in good physical condition, and his body was well-built. But his gaze was devoid of any goodwill. The name seemed somewhat familiar.

Helmut retrieved his name from distant memory.

‘Xenia?’

When he took on the request to head to Baden, Xenia mentioned that her cousin’s name was Leon.

‘I heard he’s been making a name for himself at the academy.’

Helmut, not very interested in the swordsmanship department, didn’t know, but Leon was the top of the fourth-year swordsmanship department. And he would likely defeat Nils from the sixth year.

Leon spoke with a displeased face.

“Because of your friend, my cousin cried.”

Now he realized, Leon was hostile towards Alea.

Alea’s attitude was divisive.

Now that she could control the charm of her magic, this divisiveness was even more pronounced.

“Is that guy, who looks like a girl, really that great?”

It seemed Leon had intended to just disregard this guy Helmut based solely on what Xenia said, but it didn’t appear that way.

Out of affection for his cute cousin, he must have shared various stories about academy life with her.

“Alea is the top student in the second-year magic department.”

“Is that really such a great thing that allows ignoring and disrespecting a young lady?”

In their last meeting, Alea coldly ignored Xenia. She might have cried and complained to her cousin.

Leon cherished Xenia as if she were the apple of his eye. Leon pressed for an answer when Helmut hesitated.

“Answer!”

Helmut knew how to respond here.

But did he need to?

For some reason, a chilly feeling welled up.

The hostility toward Alea was soon hostility toward Helmut himself.

Although Xenia was a decent client who paid Helmut well, that was in the past.

Helmut responded briefly.

“She was annoying.”

Leon asked suspiciously.

“Does that mean you were there too?”

“Yes. And Alea dislikes being followed around. She should know that.”

Leon’s jaw tightened. It was a clear provocation. Even Helmut was surprised at himself.

Unlike Asuka, he had never deliberately caused conflict like this within the academy before.

He had become strangely sensitive. Was it because of the impending trip to Renosa? He felt a strange aggressiveness.

If Leon attacked, Helmut would just break him. An opponent as weak as a bug.

But Leon didn’t attack. He gritted his teeth and spat out.

“Fine. We’ll see, I’m looking forward to the trip to Renosa.”

Ever since entering Greta Academy, Leon had almost never lost.

His arrogance and confidence stemmed not only from his status but also from his solid skills.

Leon was confident that he was the strongest in the Greta Academy swordsmanship department.

Due to Leon’s authoritative and arrogant personality, the hierarchy was clear in the fourth-year swordsmanship department.

Everyone followed him and acknowledged his authority. Leon was the leader.

He intended to let the rudeness of Helmut’s friend slide with an appropriate apology, but how dare he respond like this!

‘Arrogant brat! He has no respect for his senior. I’ll make sure to teach him a lesson!’

Wasn’t his name Helmut? From the first time Leon saw him, there was something unsettling about the guy. His gaze, his whole demeanor.

He disliked the fact that this second-year was rumored to have skills comparable to upperclassmen.

Leon felt that only he deserved such a reputation from a young age.

Although it was a trip with the instructor, there would be opportunities. Leon sharpened his metaphorical blade.

*

“We depart in ten days.”

Alea nodded.

“The time is rather tight, but it’ll be fine.”

“What will?”

“Just something.”

Alea mumbled. A shadow fell over her face. In ten days, they would part for a while.

Alea would go to Renosa during the holidays, but they would be separated until they met again.

Both felt an emptiness in their hearts at this fact.

Alea spoke softly.

“By the way, about that Charlotte… she’s traveling with you?.”

“Yes.”

Even though Instructor Patricia would accompany them, Charlotte would still be part of the same travel party. They might even spar.

Alea raised her eyebrows slightly.

“I’ve been thinking, it’s just a feeling that she might be related to you, right? So until it’s confirmed, you don’t know what kind of relationship it is. She might not be related at all.”

“…That’s right.”

“So it’s better if you don’t talk to her too much. She might misunderstand, you know?”

He seemed to understand what she was getting at.

“I don’t talk much anyway.”

Both Charlotte and he were quiet types.

And to be honest, they weren’t particularly close. Just a bit awkward, a bit bothersome.

“I see. Then that’s good.”

Alea smiled brightly. Helmut found himself gazing at her face for a moment, enveloped in an indescribable feeling.



H.F.C Chapter 211 (Part 1):
				Time passed quickly. There were no major changes during that period. Helmut waited patiently for the day of departure to arrive.

The anticipation was oddly exciting and yet oddly reluctant, like sailing towards a storm.

In that sea, he might find treasure, or he might be submerged forever. He couldn’t predict what would happen.

Perhaps he may even have to flee from there without revealing his identity.

There was no guarantee that his mother would recognize him, even with the name Helmut.

To his mother, he would be a dead child. It seemed like dark clouds were gathering.

Helmut found it difficult to fall asleep at night, an unusual occurrence for him.

To leave Baden, some preparations seemed necessary.

“Take this.”

The day before leaving, Alea called Helmut to her room and handed him a bracelet – one with enhanced functions from the previous one she had given.

Helmut alternated his gaze between the two bracelets on his wrist.

Strangely, it didn’t feel cumbersome.

Whether Alea had considered that, or because she was the one who gave the bracelet, he didn’t know.

“I’ll contact you at night. Answer when I call.”

Alea spoke firmly. Helmut quietly stared at the bracelet and asked doubtfully,

“Can’t I call you?”

It seemed unfair. It felt like he could only talk to her when she wanted to reach out.

Of course, Alea was the one who made the bracelet.

“You can call, but only when it’s dangerous.”

Alea pointed to a part of the bracelet. It would activate if infused with Vis.

The bracelet was initially designed to be used in dangerous situations.

But Helmut knew. He would never use the bracelet to call Alea.

He couldn’t drag her into danger if he was facing something he couldn’t handle.

“Next time we meet, I’ll have your training ground ready.”

She smiled lightly. She seemed to be planning to immerse herself in the dungeon for a while.

Although she was currently going through her final exams, it wouldn’t hinder her dungeon research.

No variable could take away Alea’s top position.

Alea left a brief remark.

“Win.”

As if it was a necessity. Or as if she believed he would.

Her amethyst-like eyes sparkled. It was a typical Alea statement.

Helmut nodded. He reached out his hand. Alea came close into his arms.

Her gaze came closer, a captivating look.

It seemed that during their time apart, he would miss her. He was certain of it.

*

Before leaving, Helmut visited Ethan Kudrow in the morning. He had received a message that Ethan wanted to see him.

“Helmut, you’re here.”

Ethan Kudrow greeted Helmut with a pat on the shoulder.

His eyes were filled with a peculiar sentiment.

It hadn’t even been a year since Helmut sought him out.

But Helmut had distinguished himself so brilliantly that he was selected as a representative of Greta Academy for the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

In that short, yet long time, Ethan Kudrow had watched over Helmut.

From the moment he first saw him, this boy was extraordinary.

He had been impressed by Helmut countless times.

It was natural to think that Helmut was the disciple chosen by Darien, but that assumption of his became inadequate to explain Helmut’s evident ability.

To Ethan Kudrow, Helmut was not merely his benefactor’s disciple.

He was a boy with exceptional intelligence and extraordinary talent, one he held a special fondness for, like a special student or a son.

Helmut’s cold and disciplined nature, without any arrogance or recklessness, was captivating.

His ability to prove himself with his sword and skills was undeniable.

‘The light emanating from a person cannot be hidden.’

Ever since he entered the academy and began to stand out, no one could ignore Helmut.

He was a boy who attracted attention like a magnet.

This was possible because he was a gem.

Although Helmut seemed closed-off, harboring a cold and weighty secret.

Ethan Kudrow also knew. That Helmut was hiding something from him.

Even though he had softened a lot, Helmut’s sharp vigilance was subtly evident.

Though he had grown accustomed to the academy, Helmut still retained a raw, primal feeling.

Vivid like a beast, capable of turning dangerous at any moment. At times, it seemed almost inhuman.

Such a boy would not have an ordinary background.

‘Above all, his talent is unbelievable.’

Talent descended through bloodlines. Especially for Vis, this was the case. Helmut’s talent was exceptional – something unlikely for a commoner.

If such a thing existed, it would be nothing short of a miracle.

That’s why the Greta Academy was filled with nobles.



H.F.C Chapter 211 (Part 2):
				‘An orphan, huh…’

Ethan Kudrow grew newly curious about Helmut’s background.

Knowing that asking would only heighten Helmut’s wariness, he swallowed his questions but still wanted to share the burden.

Given that he tried so hard to hide it, it wouldn’t be a simple story. Ethan Kudrow wasn’t sure if he could handle it.

That’s probably why Helmut didn’t speak of it either.

Helmut looked into Ethan Kudrow’s eyes. Affection could be disguised but not hidden.

That’s how Helmut could sense Alea’s heart. And though of a different kind, the same was true for Ethan Kudrow.

Helmut knew that Ethan Kudrow cared for him beyond just overseeing him.

‘He has repaid his debt to Darien by simply accepting and sponsoring me at the academy.’

But Ethan Kudrow had done more. He had given his heart.

Even Helmut couldn’t remain untouched by that fact.

Even a wild animal recognizes the human who feeds it.

Even if Ethan Kudrow turned against him, Helmut could not easily end his life.

His sword was merciless. Yet, killing him would not be easy.

Therefore, he could never tell the truth. That much was certain.

Creating a situation that might require killing him was not the right thing to do.

Ethan Kudrow had things to protect, things he possessed, a position he had already established. It was better he didn’t know.

It is only proper that a human bearing the Seed of Darkness remains that way.

Only Alea, with the vessel of an Archmage, could handle Helmut and oppose the Temple with the resolve and capacity required, without being overwhelmed by the vast darkness that was Helmut.

‘But there are things I can say.’

Not everything needs to be said; Ethan Kudrow would understand. Helmut seemed to know that too.

“In Renosa, I think I will find out about my origins.”

“Do you have family left in Renosa?”

“Well, I’m going to find out.”

Helmut deliberately left it vague.

After a pause, Ethan Kudrow spoke calmly, having gathered his thoughts.

“Return safely.”

His words were different from Alea’s.

Alea had told him to win, as if she had no doubt he would be safe.

Alea knew Helmut’s strength. Ethan Kudrow also knew, to some extent.

But his words sounded like those of a parent.

“If you cannot return, I hope you’ll at least leave a message behind.”

Ethan Kudrow knew. He knew that Helmut might leave at any time and might never return.

Helmut was too great a bird for the small nest of Greta Academy.

After a brief glance, Helmut responded tersely.

“…Yes, I will.”

As he turned to leave, Helmut was seized by a lingering doubt.

His departure was imminent. A dark premonition once again enveloped him.

What would happen if he found his mother?

If she recognized and accepted him, would he stay by her side?

If she did not accept him…

His heart skipped a beat.

If his mother turned against him…

Helmut mulled over this grim hypothesis, tasting bitterness. Until now, although there had been crises, the path had been smooth.

And now, he was nearing the end. It had been barely a year since he left the Forest of Roots!

‘Is it too fast?’

Naturally and swiftly like flowing water, Helmut had resolved the tasks before him one by one.

It wasn’t necessarily bad, but it somehow invoked unease.

The reason Helmut had staked everything to leave the Forest of Roots was his mother’s voice.

Not only did he not wish to live out his life and die in the Forest of Roots, but his mother’s voice had become an intense call beckoning him.

It was still clear. Her voice, calling his name as if etching it into him.

Even if it changed somewhat over the years, Helmut felt he would still recognize his mother’s voice instinctively.

But had her heart, his mother’s heart, still not forgotten Helmut?

‘Mother…’

After all, more than a decade had passed. No matter that he was her son, they had not spent any time together.

Margret Irene might have already erased the name Helmut from her memory and heart.

Even if there was remaining affection, it was unlikely to be significant enough to risk her current status, especially as a noble.

Even if she felt a momentary joy upon seeing him, she might be horrified to discover that Helmut carried the Seed of Darkness and attempt to cast him out.

Perhaps it was better not to reveal his identity.

Although his name, appearance and age matched, Helmut was a commoner.

It could be passed off as a coincidence. It seemed like the safer choice. It was wise not to be greedy.

But Helmut felt a desire. He had experiences of success.

Perhaps she was the one he most earnestly hoped for. Not to be shocked or afraid of him, but simply to accept him as Helmut.

‘Alea accepted me.’

Alea was a mage. Even Archmage Antiol had casually accepted his presence, so perhaps mages could accept the existence of a boy with the Seed of Darkness.

It might have appeared as something with challenges to overcome.

Mages, inherently opposed by the Temple, might see it that way.

His mother was not a mage, and he knew her thoughts would be different.

But he could not resign himself to giving up, having succeeded in every adventure so far.

‘First I’ll meet her.’

He could think about it later. Helmut put his thoughts on hold.

Soon, he would depart for Renosa.



H.F.C Chapter 212 (Part 1):
				“Helmut, take care and make sure to win it!”

“See you next year!”

In the morning, Asuka and Sian kept waving their hands.

Though they still had exams left, it didn’t matter to spend time like this.

Their second-place positions were virtually guaranteed anyway.

When he returns, the new semester would have started. The winds blowing in Baden may have changed a bit by then.

‘Though it’s not even certain if I’ll return.’

There was nothing certain about himself, but at least they were here. And Alea too.

At that moment, he felt a gaze from an upper window. Something like a purple shard sparkled by the window.

She must be looking down from there.

They had shared enough greetings last night. Even if they couldn’t see each other’s faces, they could still keep in touch.

Alea had said she would contact him.

Helmut lowered his gaze from there. Four people were waiting by the prepared carriage.

“How brazen of you to be the last one here.”

Leon clicked his tongue with a confrontational tone.

His behavior, even in front of the instructor, was without hesitation because he had that much standing in the swordsmanship department.

He had a face filled with resentment towards Helmut. He seemed full of determination to make the upcoming journey exhausting.

It didn’t matter. It didn’t bother him much.

Just, it was a pity. Helmut contained the rising murderous intent.

‘Killing him would be problematic. After all, he is the academy’s representative.’

How about disguising it as an accident? No, there might be high priests at their destination.

Without Alea accompanying him, a perfect cover-up would be impossible.

He might step on him if the opportunity arose, but he couldn’t kill him. Especially because of the Seed of Darkness.

‘An opportunity will come.’

He knew from past experiences that such people were persistent.

His conflicted heart settled back into calm. A peacefulness familiar to Helmut.

He also knew it was useless to conflict.

Most situations he faced were ones he found answers to only after confronting them.

The only things to trust were his body and sword. If he stayed true to the path ahead, a conclusion would arrive.

Instructor Patricia interrupted the conflict as if to prevent it.

“Everyone, get on the carriage quickly. We allotted extra time in case of any variables, but we have no more time to waste.”

Though it was a long journey, the luggage was piled high, the number of people was not many.

One professor from the magic department and two instructors from the swordsmanship department were accompanying.

A total of seven people.

Three carriages awaited them. The two swordsmanship instructors were Patricia and Alan.

It seemed their relationship was still undisclosed.

Or perhaps they thought it more appropriate to go together because of their relationship.

Professor Luxen from the magic department looked at Helmut.

“You’re the student who took my Understanding of Magic class in the first semester?”

“Yes.”

“Your answers were impressive, I remember. Of course, your handsome face too. I didn’t expect you to be the top student of the swordsmanship department. Your answers were so good for someone from the swordsmanship department that I wondered if you chose the wrong field.”

Helmut recalled the answer he had written.

Was it about the power of darkness? At that time, Helmut had written an answer that opposed the temple.

Being a mage, he might not care about it, but Helmut wondered if he had noticed something, and glanced at him.

He couldn’t read any specific intention from the smiling old professor.

“What are you saying? Professor Luxen, Helmut is the treasure of the swordsmanship department.”

Instructor Patricia quickly cut in as if not to let anyone covet him.

“Helmut is such a model student that he must have diligently responded even in written exams.”

“Haha! Is that so. It’s not easy to get such good grades in my class without being a student of the magic department…”

After exchanging a few more words of praise for Helmut, they got into the carriage.

Leon also got on the carriage with a face as if he had bitten a bug.

It was the first time he had experienced not being the center of attention in front of the instructors in a gathering of students.

Helmut happened to be in the same carriage as Instructor Patricia and Charlotte, whom Alea had warned him to avoid.

“Nice to meet you, senior.”

Charlotte bowed her head in greeting.

She was polite but not servile. She maintained her dignity while being respectful.

She was definitely not a commoner. Then what position among the nobility?

Helmut couldn’t easily guess.

“Do you have something to say to me?”

Sensing his gaze, Charlotte asked with wide eyes.

She and Helmut looked very alike. But unlike Helmut’s sharp impression, Charlotte had a neat yet somewhat gentle face.

There was no coldness that repelled others in her. Was it because of her character?

“Nothing.”

It would be troublesome to cause any misunderstanding. At any rate, Charlotte had no inkling about Helmut’s true identity.

Though he wouldn’t have any reason to like Charlotte, he had to consider the possibility that she might have a liking for him.



H.F.C Chapter 212 (Part 2):
				Instructor Patricia chuckled as if teasing.

“Helmut, Charlotte! We have the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament ahead! It would be troublesome if male and female students fall for each other.”

“Fall for each other? That’s a bit improper.”

Charlotte seemed to take it seriously, as if she really didn’t want such a misunderstanding.

Fortunately, she didn’t seem to have any feelings for Helmut.

Charlotte was a model student cherished by Instructor Patricia and also someone who was fun to tease.

She subtly smiled.

“Why? It’s possible to fall for each other. A journey with healthy male and female students together. Besides, isn’t Helmut very handsome? Though he’s clueless, I hear there are girls who secretly like him.”

‘Is that so.’

Helmut himself was completely unaware of this. It was partly because Alea had been blocking them without him knowing.

“That’s true, but Helmut senior is not my type.”

Charlotte said firmly.

Helmut felt somewhat strange. It was the first time he experienced being told he wasn’t someone’s type to his face. No one would feel good hearing that.

Of course, for Helmut, it was just a novel experience.

Charlotte realized her mistake and slightly bowed her head.

“My apologies.”

“Then what is Charlotte’s type?”

Instructor Patricia asked insinuatingly.

This question piqued Helmut’s interest a bit. He thought of someone who had been glancing at her while pretending to greet.

After some serious consideration, Charlotte answered.

“I suppose someone with good conduct and maturity would be nice.”

‘Asuka is out of the question.’

Helmut concluded simply. Even if Asuka were reborn, it would be impossible to meet Charlotte’s standards.

Maybe he’d change by the time he was on his deathbed.

Helmut, who didn’t want to be connected to Asuka by any family relationship, was pleased with this.

“What about appearance? Don’t you look at the face?”

“I think it’s impolite not to prioritize the inner qualities when looking at a person.”

Instructor Patricia was sure. If it were Charlotte, she would have scored full marks in Greta Academy’s ethics test.

But soon, Charlotte added.

“However, since I’m still lacking myself…I’d prefer someone good-looking if possible. But of course, the inside is more important.”

She added firmly and then turned her head toward the window of the carriage, seemingly embarrassed.

Instructor Patricia chuckled.

“Honest, I like it.”

Helmut felt a faint ember of hope glowing in the darkness. It was a hope he thought had completely extinguished in Asuka.

It seemed there might be a slim chance for him. Even if it was a very low possibility.

*

“Senior, is this Helmut guy really that great?”

Having been deprived of the faculty’s attention as the swordsmanship department’s representative and not being able to sit in the same carriage as Charlotte, whom he secretly had an interest in, Leon was annoyed.

He didn’t like that Helmut guy in many ways.

He asked his senior, Nils, in a tone that sounded as if he was addressing a subordinate.

In the swordsmanship department, strength determined rank. A higher grade might grant some privileges, but…

In Greta Academy, the hierarchy was especially clear. At the point of graduating, there was a limit to how much more they could improve.

Nils was aware of being beneath Leon. He answered calmly.

“Rumor has it he defeated a first-rank mercenary-level assassin.”

“First-rank mercenary-level? It’s just a rumor. There’s no way a second-year could do that.”

“If the instructors said it, it’s not just a rumor.”

“That’s…”

Leon’s face hardened. But he soon changed his expression.

“Anyway, the guy is arrogant, isn’t he?”

“Yeah.”

Nils responded lightly. Leon spoke in an insinuating tone.

“There’s a way to teach an arrogant junior in the swordsmanship department’s way. I’ll have to show him.”

Nils looked at him indifferently and nodded. It didn’t matter to him anyway.

He couldn’t stop Leon, and minor quarrels were common in the swordsmanship department.

If it went too far, the instructors would intervene. But as the senior-most student in the group, he added one more word.

“I hope there won’t be any big commotion.”

“Of course.”

Leon smiled with a cold face.

*

The first campsite after leaving Baden. As the faculty stepped aside to discuss the schedule, the four students were left alone.

While unloading the luggage and tying up the horses, a call came from behind.

“You, Helmut!”

It was an unwelcome voice.

“Don’t you hear the senior’s words?”

Helmut responded indifferently.

“Yes.”

“Go fetch some water. It’s your job.”

Leon ordered arrogantly, pointing towards the water container.

Helmut’s eyebrows raised slightly. A new feeling. Fetching water was a task for a fourth-rank mercenary, the very bottom, among mercenaries.

This guy was currently treating Helmut as a grunt.

But Helmut decided not to get angry or retaliate.

If Leon’s hierarchy was based on grade, it shouldn’t be Helmut doing the task.

Helmut pointed to the water container and ordered.

“Charlotte, go fetch the water.”

“Yes.”

Without a word, Charlotte stepped forward.

It didn’t make sense for Helmut, a second-year, to do the work while Charlotte, a first-year, just sat there.

Even if her original status didn’t fit such tasks.

Nils, who had been watching, had a bewildered expression.

He also didn’t particularly like Helmut. His reason differed from Leon’s.

He simply didn’t like the dangerous aura Helmut seemed to exude.

But he didn’t expect Helmut to dodge the task like this.

Charlotte immediately picked up the water container. Her hands firmly grasped the heavy container’s handle.

“Then I’ll be back.”



H.F.C Chapter 213 (Part 1):
				‘What on earth is this brat doing now? How dare he act like that towards Charlotte!’

Leon was worried that Charlotte’s impression of him would worsen because of this situation. His face puffed up with anger as he spoke coldly.

“Charlotte, stop. I told Helmut to do it.”

“It’s my job to do.”

Charlotte did not back down. She knew Leon was trying to establish hierarchy over Helmut.

It wasn’t out of an intention to shield Helmut. If Helmut told her to do it, it was right for her to do it.

Helmut responded indifferently.

“She says it’s her job.”

It sounded somewhat provoking. Leon, holding back his anger, shouted at him.

“Do you even think? How can you make a small girl do such a thing!”

Most of the students in the swordsmanship department were large and muscular. Compared to them, Charlotte, being a girl, looked small and fragile.

Despite the fact that she was the top student in the first year of the swordsmanship department and knew how to handle Vis, making her do this task seemed inappropriate.

Of course, Helmut was free from such notions.

In the Forest of Roots, even the most beautiful flowers could devour humans.

He knew Charlotte was strong, beyond what was visible to the eye.

“It’s my job to do this. Senior, I’m not weak. I can carry a water bucket.”

Before Helmut could say anything, Charlotte interrupted sharply, her eyes showing she felt insulted.

She quickly shouldered the water bucket and walked away.

Leon’s face turned icy as he gritted his teeth at Charlotte’s reaction.

‘Could Charlotte really be interested in that guy?’

It couldn’t be. But Helmut, with his impressive appearance, was indeed eye-catching.

Leon felt a surge of resentment. He didn’t know Charlotte well, but based on her striking looks and character, he assumed she was from a high-ranking noble family.

Most noble girls pursued academics or magic.

A noble girl discussing swords was extremely rare.

This rarity piqued Leon’s interest in Charlotte. Winning her over would undoubtedly be valuable.

He had planned to cautiously approach her during this opportunity, but it was ruined from the start.

Because of that Helmut!

As soon as Charlotte disappeared, Leon lashed out in a harsh tone.

“Since entering Greta Academy, I haven’t had much contact with commoners, so I didn’t realize how lowly they are! Making a woman do your job is truly a commoner’s thinking. I must have overestimated you!”

It was true that studying alongside commoners was unpleasant for Leon, but he was at the pinnacle of the swordsmanship department.

To begin with, the bootlickers around him were all nobles.

Naturally, he hadn’t had many opportunities to express his discriminatory attitude towards commoners.

The academy’s education also regulated such behavior.

However, at the moment a commoner annoyed him, his consciousness leaked out.

If there was a visible flaw, he had to pick at every fault.

Leon faithfully adhered to the principles of combat.

Helmut responded swiftly.

“It seems Charlotte doesn’t agree with your thoughts, senior.”

“Don’t you dare call her by her name!”

‘What’s going on here?’

Helmut’s brow furrowed. It felt like he was caught in the middle of a romantic feud. The problem was, Helmut had no intention of fighting over Charlotte.

Unable to watch any longer, Nils intervened. He thought Leon went a bit too far with the commoner remarks.

He was a principled person, but that didn’t mean he wanted to side with Helmut.

“I heard Charlotte is from Renosa. Heading to Renosa now, it doesn’t look good to assign such chores to a noble from Renosa.”

Helmut tilted his head slightly.

When they reach Renosa, they’ll be staying in lodgings with servants anyway.

The academy-selected students would be treated accordingly.

So there was no problem doing menial tasks until then. The Renosa people wouldn’t know.

In any case, Helmut had no intention of doing whatever Leon instructed, and Charlotte didn’t refuse the assignment. That was enough.

Helmut cut him off coldly.

“Whether she’s from Renosa or not doesn’t matter in doing the given tasks.”

If she didn’t like it, she could refuse. If Charlotte refused, Helmut would say he wouldn’t do it either.

Leon was just being annoying. He could just challenge him to a duel directly.

Finally, Leon moved as Helmut had expected.

“Fine, I see you’re not getting it. I need to fix your attitude!”

Leon stood up abruptly, holding a wooden sword.

Had he been looking for an excuse to beat him up?

‘It won’t go as you wish.’

Helmut looked at him indifferently. He was tired of dealing with weaklings.

It was a bit inconvenient too. He had to control his strength to avoid killing him.

Ironically, Leon seemed confident he would win.

Even though he had never seen Helmut’s skills!

He would soon realize that it was a big mistake, and who the real contender for victory among Greta Academy’s selected students was.



H.F.C Chapter 213 (Part 2):
				However, before they could clash, there was an intruder. The Instructors, who had just finished their discussion, appeared.

Seeing the confrontation between Leon and Helmut, they paused.

There was no romantic tension between Instructor Alan and Instructor Patricia during work.

Sensing the unusual atmosphere, Instructor Alan crossed his arms and asked.

“What happened?”

Leon quickly denied. A fabricated smile appeared on his lips.

“Nothing. I was just about to duel with a junior, but it doesn’t seem like the right time.”

There was no benefit to fighting in front of an instructor. He wasn’t really looking for a dueling match anyway.

Instructor Alan didn’t ask further. He judged that intervening in trivial quarrels would have negative effects.

‘Helmut isn’t particularly aggressive, but he strangely attracts fights.’

Maybe it was because of his cold and intimidating demeanor.

Helmut had a knack for provoking swordsmen.

The ambiguity of his skills. His appearance was almost delicate, but his aura wasn’t, creating a contradiction that made others want to challenge him.

Unable to judge, they had to test him.

This was why Helmut often got into fights in Basor.

Instructor Patricia looked around and asked.

“Where’s Charlotte?”

“She went to fetch water.”

In truth, they had brought enough drinking water, and there were mages as well.

There wasn’t a real shortage of water. Instructor Alan frowned.

“Fetch water… Well, maybe it’s because she’s a first-year student. But it’s better not to act alone. This isn’t Greta Academy, so we don’t know what might happen. Always stay together. Helmut, go to the water’s edge.”

“Yes.”

Helmut readily left.

When he reached the water’s edge, Charlotte was sighing deeply with a fully filled water bucket in front of her.

Her face was filled with worry.

‘Is it too heavy for her to lift alone?’

Helmut thought she wouldn’t be that weak, but he asked.

“Is it too heavy for you to carry?”

Charlotte turned around in surprise. Only then did Helmut realize that he had been deadening his footsteps.

It wasn’t that he was trying to ambush someone, it was just a habit. Especially in forests like this.

“You move so quietly, senior.”

Charlotte looked embarrassed, as if ashamed of letting her guard down in a place where she could be attacked at any time.

“I can carry it alone. I was just about to head back. I had something on my mind for a bit. You can go ahead.”

“The instructor said not to act alone.”

“…I see. Then could you give me a moment?”

Charlotte’s expression darkened. Judging by her overall condition, she wasn’t physically unwell.

It was probably a matter of the heart.

‘Could it be because I made her do this task?’

He didn’t know why that would upset her, but he had something to say.

“It wasn’t me who made you do it.”

Helmut himself was aware that he hadn’t done anything wrong, but from the reactions of the other two seniors, he wondered if he had done something strange.

‘I’m still not fully accustomed to the human world.’

But Charlotte nodded readily.

“I know. However, regardless of that, it didn’t seem right to unnecessarily have juniors run errands for the sake of establishing hierarchy.”

She added an unnecessary comment, typical of her. Charlotte wasn’t a fool.

“If I was upset over that, it’s not your fault, senior.”

If it wasn’t Helmut’s fault, it was Leon’s. The conclusion was clear.

There was a brief silence. In the place where only the sound of the stream flowing could be heard, the silence was not too noticeable.

Both were not talkative. Helmut waited leisurely while standing, and Charlotte was lost in thought, watching the flowing water.

Suddenly, she raised her head.

“Senior, I have something to ask.”

“What is it?”

If it was about Margret Irene, he couldn’t tell her.

Helmut hadn’t decided what to do yet.

But Charlotte’s intention was different.

“It’s a trivial concern, but I have no one to ask. I thought you’d listen without any judgment…”

Her words implied that he was insensitive enough to listen to anything without reacting.

But Helmut wasn’t offended. He was indeed indifferent.

“Go ahead.”

“Please don’t tell anyone.”

For a moment, Alea crossed his mind.

Should he keep it a secret from Alea too?

Didn’t she repeatedly tell him not to talk much with Charlotte?

But Helmut trusted his instincts. Charlotte was his blood relative.

After a moment of hesitation, he replied.

“I won’t.”

Charlotte’s voice flowed out slowly.

“What would you do, senior, if your sibling disliked you?”

“I don’t know because I don’t have siblings.”

Isn’t it an emotion one can understand only after having siblings who dislike them?

Humans kill their siblings and parents for power. Is it a big deal if siblings don’t get along?

Charlotte seemed to be troubled by this fact.

“If not siblings, then let’s say relatives. The term ‘family’ would work too, I suppose. What would you do if someone you couldn’t ignore disliked you, senior?”

She was worried about Michael.

Since leaving Renosa, her heart had been restless.

Michael had sent another letter. He wanted to see her face as soon as she arrived in Renosa.

She didn’t understand why he was acting like this suddenly.

It couldn’t be that his heart had softened from not seeing her for a long time. The Michael she knew wasn’t such a tender boy.

So, it troubled her even more.



H.F.C Chapter 214 (Part 1):
				‘What could be his intention?’

He may have initially seen Charlotte as a rival, but now he seems to be trying to absorb her.

There was always a reason behind Michael’s kindness. The reason he didn’t attend the academy wasn’t simply due to his health issues.

It was to solidify his position as the heir of the family while Charlotte was away.

When Charlotte returns, everyone in the family will likely be following Michael.

Helmut’s answer was simple.

“Why don’t you ask him why he dislikes you?”

First, she needed to confirm whether he disliked her or not, but after that, the reason was crucial.

Charlotte spoke again.

“I know why he dislikes me. But yes, I’ve never actually asked him.”

She could only guess. Charlotte found Michael difficult.

It seemed she had never once gotten angry with him.

Charlotte merely endured Michael’s biting remarks and his hostility.

She carried that vaguely understood reason within her.

“What will you do once you find out why he dislikes you?”

“I’ll just leave it be.”

Charlotte’s eyes widened.

“Don’t you feel like you should…do something about it if you were in a similar situation?”

“Well, I don’t know how to change someone’s heart.”

Helmut had never learned how to do that, and he knew he wasn’t good at it.

The idea that a sibling might dislike him wasn’t surprising.

Even if his mother accepted him, Helmut was still an outsider.

It wouldn’t be easy for his siblings to accept him just because they shared blood.

Nobles had a lot to lose. Would they really welcome a sibling who might divide their inheritance?

Helmut had no intention of disrupting their order. He had no need for wealth; he already had plenty.

Of course, things might be different if they ever met.

Even without knowing about the Seed of Darkness, if Helmut’s mere existence bothered them, there was nothing he could do about it.

If he couldn’t beat them up to establish a hierarchy or kill them, the answer was simple.

Just face them. But the moment of confrontation had not yet come.

It was too early to think about potential siblings who might or might not exist and how they would treat him.

Helmut calmly responded,

“But I know what I have to do.”

Charlotte suddenly realized. What’s important now isn’t Michael’s heart, which she may or may not find out even after meeting him.

It was the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament.

Helmut had an impressive ability to reach conclusions quickly.

Helmut’s resoluteness dispelled Charlotte’s worries.

Even though she was aware, she still got lost in her thoughts. Now, her mind was clear, and she nodded.

“I see.”

It felt strange yet amazing. Charlotte had always been impressed by Helmut’s strength, his swordsmanship, and his diligence.

As a fellow swordsman and senior, there was much to learn from him.

Though she didn’t have feelings for him, she thought of him as a good senior.

“You’re right, senior.”

“Let’s go.”

Helmut suggested briefly. He calculated in his mind that the conversation wasn’t too long.

Charlotte seemed to notice something and stood up.

“Oh, I heard you have a fiancée or girlfriend. My apologies, she might be displeased.”

Helmut flinched and replied.

“She probably would be.”

But what’s done is done. He decided to ask something as well.

“If you’re from Renosa, you must have family there.”

Helmut asked casually. Charlotte hesitated and said.

“Yes, that’s right. If you go to Renosa… you might be surprised.”

“Surprised?”

“Yes, because my family is a bit…”

Charlotte hesitated. Should she just tell him?

He would find out eventually, but telling him now would break the academy’s rules.

Even if it did, no one would know she broke the rules unless Helmut spoke of it.

Just as Charlotte decided to speak, a cold voice interrupted from a distance.

“What are you doing there? Have you been dawdling all this time?”

It was Leon. As he walked down the slope, he threw a fierce gaze at Helmut.

Leon was concerned about Helmut and Charlotte being alone and had come to check on them.

Seeing them talking made him uncomfortable. They seemed quite close, and it twisted something inside him.

“My apologies. I was just about to leave.”

Charlotte quickly grabbed the water jug and moved.

She didn’t seem to notice the heavy weight of the jug.

Charlotte left first, and Helmut was about to return to the camp.

However, as he passed Leon, Leon suddenly spoke.

“She’s a noble. You’re a commoner.”

The tone suggested that he shouldn’t be looking at an unattainable tree. Helmut calmly asked.

“Aren’t we all students of the academy?”

“Once you leave the academy, you won’t be. Although we follow the academy rules inside, everyone knows that fact. It seems you don’t know.”

Even if he knew, it didn’t matter. Would the noble status protect his neck from Helmut’s sword?

Probably not. This guy didn’t even have the skills to ensure that.

Helmut looked at him with cold eyes.

Meeting those chilling black eyes, Leon felt an inexplicable intimidation.

However, he tried hard to pull himself together.

No matter how ominous those pitch-black eyes looked or how strange a feeling the other person gave off, he was just a second-year student. It didn’t make sense for him to feel intimidated!

Leon gritted his teeth and asked.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“Senior doesn’t like me.”

“Yes, and what will you do about it?”

Helmut’s gaze deepened, as if a chasm was opening in his eyes.

“Then instead of being a nuisance, let’s duel.”



H.F.C Chapter 214 (Part 2):
				The instructors didn’t monitor them all the time.

They could secretly clash at night, or if he didn’t like that, they could officially challenge each other.

Helmut was thinking it might be simpler to resolve it through a show of strength.

Leon’s face turned red with anger.

“What? You think you can beat me?”

“Of course.”

Helmut answered briefly, a slight smirk on his lips.

“Why don’t you find out? I’d prefer using real swords.”

He had heard that the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament used real swords.

It was closer to actual combat compared to tournaments held within the academy.

The feel of a real sword was different from a wooden one.

In a real sword duel, he could pretend it was a mistake and put the opponent in a more dangerous position.

Of course, he wouldn’t kill him.

Professor Luxen from the magic department would be there. As long as he didn’t die instantly, it wouldn’t be too difficult to handle such situations.

Anyway, as long as they arrived at Renosa safely, that’s all that mattered, right?

Whatever murderous thoughts Helmut had, Leon was unaware.

He was filled with the anger of having to teach this arrogant second-year a lesson.

But Leon was also an outstanding swordsman. If not for Helmut, he could represent the entire academy.

An outstanding swordsman should be able to assess the situation.

They can’t fight with agitated minds. What if he ended up killing this guy?

Leon knew Helmut was one of the selected students from Greta Academy. Causing trouble openly wasn’t Leon’s style.

He was also concerned about the instructors’ evaluations and his own reputation.

That’s why he had only prodded lightly.

Barely containing his anger, Leon asked.

“You mean you won’t avoid the duel?”

“I have no reason to.”

Helmut’s tone was indifferent. If the other side provoked him, he could provoke back.

A confrontation would be simpler.

‘Arrogant brat!’

To Leon, Helmut’s words sounded dismissive.

Leon didn’t think Helmut had any basis for his confidence. His pride didn’t allow him to believe Helmut was better.

Even though he had heard about Helmut’s reputation, his pride blinded him.

It should have been easy to understand.

A commoner wouldn’t be so confident unless he had the skills to back it up.

Leon composed himself and spoke in a calm tone.

“Fine, I’ll inform the instructor. We’ll have a duel.”

“You plan to duel in front of everyone?”

That would be appropriate, but it felt a bit disappointing.

Helmut had been relatively quiet since the first semester’s quarrel.

He would have to hold back in front of the instructors. A hint of killing intent flickered in his black eyes.

Leon proudly declared.

“Yes, of course. You will understand your own skill and position clearly in front of everyone!”

“Let’s do that then.”

Helmut replied indifferently. He turned away. The matter would be resolved before they reached Renosa.

*

It was late at night. As usual, Helmut was training.

He had informed the instructor that he was stepping out for some training.

The rule against acting alone didn’t apply to Helmut. His skills were well known among the instructors.

Helmut was someone who might endanger others but wouldn’t be endangered by anyone.

Instructor Patricia had only given a word of caution.

“Don’t go too far.”

As he was swinging his sword, his bracelet lit up.

Helmut knew it was a call from Alea.

He infused the bracelet with Vis, and a small image of Alea’s face appeared before him.

Her silver hair was illuminated clearly. It was Alea’s room.

She was sitting at her desk, her hair down.

The image was so vivid it felt like she was right in front of him.

“Hello.”

She smiled brightly and asked about his day.

Helmut hesitated briefly. He had said he wouldn’t tell Charlotte.

But what if Alea was curious about their conversation?

Fortunately, Alea was more interested in another matter.

“So, you’re going to duel?”

“He suggested it.”

“Good. Crush him.”

Alea said cheerfully and then added.

“Oh, but be careful. He’s from a Marquess family in the empire. If you handle it like in the first semester, it might become troublesome for you.”

“It will be a supervised duel.”

“And you talked with Charlotte?”

Alea’s focus returned to that.

Fortunately, perhaps because Helmut had mentioned the conversation with Instructor Petrishia in the carriage, Alea didn’t seem too concerned.

“If you’re curious about Charlotte, shall I look into it? I can find out which family she’s from in a day.”

Alea laughed.

She had connections with the dean. Though the dean wouldn’t tell her everything, Alea could subtly find out what she wanted to know from him.



H.F.C Chapter 215 (Part 1):
				“No.”

Helmut firmly refused. This wasn’t the first time Alea had made a similar suggestion. Helmut had rejected it before as well.

It was a refusal he couldn’t quite explain himself. While it was obvious that acquiring information in advance was advantageous, he simply couldn’t accept it.

“Alright.”

Regardless of Helmut’s decision, Alea nodded readily.

But internally, she had different thoughts.

‘Still, I should investigate.’

She had some suspicions. Even if Helmut didn’t care, she had to be prepared. They were already in the same boat.

Alea’s voice softened suddenly.

“You must be confident that she is your family, seeing how you converse with her so casually without listening to me.”

Her tone was gentle but carried a sharp edge. Helmut paused for a moment.

“…I am confident. It’s not that I ignored your words.”

“Is that so? I’ll trust you then.”

For some reason, the way she said “I’ll trust you” sounded ominous.

“Get some rest then. See you tomorrow.”

With a cheerful voice, the connection was cut off. Helmut’s training session also came to an end, leaving him with an inexplicable feeling of unease.

Once they arrived at the village and settled into the inn, Leon hurried.

He was eager to deal with that arrogant kid. It seemed Charlotte and Helmut had become somewhat closer after their conversation by the water that day.

The sight of them occasionally chatting really grated on him.

‘There’s no way Charlotte would end up with a commoner.’

A commoner capable of rising in status could marry a noble.

But that was only a story for lower nobles. Nobles recognize each other.

In Leon’s eyes, Charlot was not of a status to end up with some commoner.

She wasn’t the type to play with fire either, so it wouldn’t progress any further. He knew that in his head. But his heart felt grated.

Leon went straight to Instructor Alan.

“Instructor, I have something to discuss.”

“What is it?”

“We still have a long journey to Renosa. I would like to duel.”

Instructor Alan immediately understood his intent.

“You want to duel with Helmut?”

“Yes, that’s right. He has excellent skills. This dueling will be beneficial for both of us.”

Instructor Alan hesitated.

Not for any other reason. Leon couldn’t defeat Helmut. If he lost in front of everyone, Leon’s self-esteem would take a hit.

He was the top student representative of Greta Academy. Instructor Alan knew he was superior to Nils.

‘If Leon takes a hit, will he easily recover?’

As a third-year top student, losing to Helmut and losing confidence could lead to him losing to Charlotte, who was less skilled than him.

Losing confidence in one’s skills immediately reflects in their swordsmanship.

If the representative of Greta Academy became demoralized and was eliminated early in the upcoming swordsmanship competition, it would be problematic.

However, he couldn’t just refuse the formal request for a dueling match.

Instructor Alan furrowed his brows.

“Please allow us to duel with real swords?”

Leon’s voice carried blatant hostility. He didn’t intend to kill him by accident. He didn’t want to fall out of favor with the instructor. However, to make an impression, real swords would be more effective.

Instructor Alan soon nodded.

“Alright. If it’s under the supervision of an instructor at an appropriate place.”

“It certainly will be.”

Helmut agreed, and soon a place was arranged. Helmut and Leon stood facing each other in an open area.

Inns often housed mercenaries, so larger inns usually had training grounds or similar open spaces.

Leon felt an indescribable sensation as he looked into Helmut’s jet-black eyes.

Until being led to this place, Helmut had been quiet.

Leon had expected him to be afraid, but Helmut’s calm reaction was unexpected.

‘What’s going on? Why is this brat so calm?’

Beyond the feeling that Helmut wouldn’t be easy to defeat, Leon belatedly felt an inexplicable unease.

However, Leon quickly shook off that unease. His pride wouldn’t allow him to back down here.

Leon’s sword had never betrayed him. He had hardly ever lost to his peers. Victory was a habit for him.

‘I will win this time as well.’

And he would make that unpleasant guy kneel, as befits the representative of Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department.

‘As expected… the outcome is obvious. It can’t be helped.’

Wondering if the duel would be meaningful, Instructor Patricia crossed her arms and asked.

“Shall Charlotte and Nils duel as well?”

“It would be an honor if given the chance.”

Charlotte replied stiffly. Nils shook his head.

“The size difference is too large, so it won’t help either of us prepare for the tournament.”

Nils looked troubled. Charlotte was a petite girl, not even half Nils’ size.

Although tall and well-built for her age, in the swordsmanship department she would be considered tiny.

From Nils’ perspective, being strong and healthy, he was worried he might accidentally hurt her.

Charlotte insisted firmly.

“Still, I request it.”

“Well, if Charlot requests it, let’s give it a try.”

“Then, I would like to watch Helmut and Leon’s duel first.”

Nils reluctantly agreed.



H.F.C Chapter 215 (Part 2):
				Everyone’s eyes turned to Helmut and Leon standing face-to-face.

Neither had drawn their swords yet. Helmut brought his hand to his waist.

The sword hilt fit perfectly into his hand. He had already wielded this sword countless times, cutting down enemies.

For Helmut, not cutting properly with a real sword was more unusual.

“You may use Vis, but do not exceed its use beyond physical enhancement.”

Instructor Alan set detailed conditions. Both nodded.

“Understood.”

‘Let’s get started.’

Leon grasped his sword and twitched his fingertips. An inexplicable sense of urgency surged.

Meanwhile, Helmut remained composed. He wasn’t interested in what Leon was thinking.

The outcome was already determined.

Helmut took a deep breath. Instructor Alan raised his hand to signal the start.

“Begin!”

At the shout, his hand came down sharply.

Simultaneously, Helmut moved. His movement was so smooth, it was as if he was not hindered by air resistance.

Leon’s sword was drawn too. But his sword did nothing.

Whoosh! A sharp sound and a flash of light appeared before his eyes.

Light first, sound second.

A white trajectory cut through the air. Leon saw the trajectory.

But by the time he recognized it, everything was over. It was as if an invisible light had pierced through his entire body.

His vision was blocked. By a very thin, sharp light.

Leon realized what had stopped in front of him. It was the tip of a sword emitting a sharp light.

A sword stopped just a hair’s breadth away from his eyes! As if it could pierce them at any moment!

Leon’s sword couldn’t even move toward the air.

His mouth froze. His legs trembled. A momentary fear engulfed him. A murderous intent that triggered it.

The gates of death had opened their jaws right before him. Leon realized it.

‘He really intended to kill me.’

The killing intent was that of an unfeeling sword. A sword has no heart. Helmut’s killing intent contained no hesitation.

The only reason he stopped was because it was against the rules to kill.

And because the instructors were watching.

His body was covered in goosebumps. It was as if he had witnessed the true nature of someone who had committed countless murders, seeing his inhuman coldness.

Although Leon was the top fourth-year student in the swordsmanship department of Greta Academy, he lacked real combat experience.

The killing intent that could be found only in battlefield knights overwhelmed him in an instant.

‘Wh…What kind of guy is he?!’

It felt like he had touched something he shouldn’t have.

It was as if he had glimpsed the fangs of a beast hidden in a human face.

Looking at Leon’s pale face, Helmut asked expressionlessly.

“Shall we go again?”

But there was no answer.

“Let’s do it one more time.”

Helmut changed his tone. He slightly regretted it.

It ended too quickly.

His goal was to make him covered in wounds. What he did wasn’t enough as a threat.

Unconsciously, he had completely immersed himself and drawn his sword. He hadn’t intended to show that he could finish someone like Leon with a single strike.

The sword drawn with full power stopped just before piercing him.

Stopping was more surprising. Helmut had allowed his murderous instinct to take over.

He didn’t consider the instructors or professors watching at all.

Immersion in the sword invites killing. Helmut knew that was the latent savagery within him.

He couldn’t definitively say it was the influence of the Seed of Darkness.

However, a tiny bit of consciousness had stopped him. Helmut let out a sigh of relief.

‘Have I become human enough to control my instincts?’

If so, that’s fortunate. Perhaps because he was holding a real sword. He had been so immersed that he had lost control momentarily.

His intense and combat-driven real-life experience had pulled him in.

It was as if it had already become a part of him. To eliminate the enemy most efficiently and quickly. Thus, leading to uncontrollable directions.

“We should stop here.”

Instructor Alan intervened. Leon, his face pale, stormed off the field.

Unable to bear the humiliation that hit him late.

Professor Luxen, standing beside, tilted his head.

‘Something is strange. That boy.’

His exam papers were impressive. That’s why he had taken notice of him.

But aside from that, something felt different about him from other boys.

It was as if some part of him, as a human, was missing.

And because of that, some other aspect was sharply honed.

‘Extraordinary talent sometimes makes a person inhuman. But…’

There was something peculiar about Helmut. That peculiarity piqued the mage’s curiosity.

Professor Luxen’s eyes glimmered.

‘I need to keep an eye on him.’

Nils and Charlotte, who had been watching with admiration, took their positions for their turn at dueling.

Helmut loosened his nerves and sat down to one side.

Instructor Patricia approached and spoke.

“Excellent. It seems you have grown further.”

Clearly, Helmut was in a realm that Instructor Patricia couldn’t measure.

But an instructor’s eyes could see beyond realms.

Helmut nodded.

“Yes.”

“Can we expect you to win the upcoming swordsmanship tournament? Don’t hold too much against Leon. He must have realized by now.”

Why the instructors treated Helmut differently was clear. Helmut replied curtly,

“I won’t.”

No need to resent him. He was insignificant, simply weak. That’s how the weak are.

A cutting contempt seeped through his thoughts, and he felt a keen murderous intent.

He was startled. It felt strange. It was as if an invisible force was affecting him. Was it because he was heading to Renosa?

He looked down at his own hand. Strong and steady. It seemed unable to detect any anomaly.

The following duel match ended with Nils’ victory.



H.F.C Chapter 216 (Part 1):
				“You’re quite something, you know.”

Nils extended his hand. Charlotte took it and stood up without resistance.

The opponent was a sixth-year student. She knew it would be hard to win.

But still, the pride of a swordsman couldn’t help but feel bitter.

Charlotte was an honor student. Despite having met formidable opponents like Helmut and Asuka, she wasn’t used to losing.

She couldn’t help but ask herself the question.

‘If it were Senior Asuka, would he have lost like this?’

She didn’t need to consider Helmut; even if it were Asuka. If Asuka were here instead.

No. The answer was immediate. Asuka would not have lost to Nils. Even if the opponent was the top of the sixth year, Asuka would have prevailed.

Asuka’s presence weighed heavily on Charlotte. His swordsmanship was impressive beyond mere strength.

She had never seen such an aggressive and instinctive swordsman. Charlotte knew she wouldn’t be able to shake off the thought of ‘If it were Senior Asuka’ throughout the tournament.

Because she had become the representative of the Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department in his place.

At the very least, she had to fill the void left by his absence. Charlotte was diligent to the point that she couldn’t shake off that burden.

Charlotte had also realized that Asuka had conceded it to her. But she had no interest in his true intentions.

One thing was clear: it was not desirable for her to be the representative of Greta Academy. Charlotte gritted her teeth.

“I can see you weren’t chosen as the representative for nothing. Let’s duel often in the future.”

Nils’ words were sincere.

As he dueled with Charlotte, he was inwardly impressed. He had underestimated her because she was a small girl, but as soon as the match began, he forgot that prejudice.

Charlotte’s sword was light, quick, and concealed its sharpness.

Because the opponent was small, it was even more challenging for Nils, who had a large build, to deal with her.

Thinking about the upcoming tournament, dueling with her would be very helpful.

Getting used to opponents as small and quick as Charlotte would make other opponents seem sluggish by comparison.

“Let’s do that.”

Charlotte nodded. In the future matches leading up to Renosa, she aimed to defeat Nils. Even if just once.

That was her newly formed goal.

*

That day, Leon unexpectedly accepted it calmly. He acknowledged that he had lost and that Helmut was stronger than him.

No, he had no choice but to accept it. The death that had approached his very eyes had robbed him of his fighting spirit.

Helmut had etched the fear of death into him.

After that, Leon, who had become remarkably quiet, started avoiding Helmut.

Since they traveled in separate carriages anyway, avoiding him wasn’t difficult. It was the first complete defeat he had ever faced against someone his age.

A beaten dog doesn’t dare to bark. Especially not in the swordsmanship department.

‘Maybe because he has some skill, he understands his place quickly.’

Helmut felt a slight disappointment. The journey to Renosa was smooth.

So smooth that it felt almost boring.

Traveling with the Greta Academy faculty, there could have been a blind bandit attacking the carriage emblazoned with the Greta Academy crest, but fortunately or unfortunately, that didn’t happen.

Except for Leon, the others chatted quite a bit.

Helmut also exchanged a few words with Nils, thanks to Charlotte being a bridge.

Nils, having seen Helmut’s skills, was strangely respectful towards him.

The hierarchical relationship based on school years was already meaningless. Naturally, Helmut was placed at the top of the hierarchy, excluding the faculty.

Helmut felt just one discomfort.

‘Professor Luxen… he’s a bit irritating.’

Luxen kept trying to talk to him and follow him during training.

If it had been a female professor, one might suspect romantic interest. Luxen’s blatant interest in Helmut was obvious to anyone.

Of course, even for a male professor, one might wonder if he had some peculiar taste. Helmut was undeniably a handsome boy.

More than anything, it was annoying when he tried to converse with Alea.

If this side doesn’t respond, communication cannot be established even if Alea attempts it.

Because of Professor Luxen, Helmut had to reject Alea’s communication several times.

Fortunately, after Helmut outright said that he was being a nuisance, Luxen stopped following him at least during training.

Alea, hearing the story, simply commented.

“Professor Luxen doesn’t have those kinds of inclinations.”

That was all he needed to hear. Alea then gave him some vague warning.

“Be careful. My bracelet can conceal it, but still.”

The existence of the Seed of Darkness must not be revealed. That was the message.

Anyway, the carriage continued to trundle along. The Greta Academy group finally reached Renosa.



H.F.C Chapter 216 (Part 2):
				“It’s fortunate we arrived at our destination without any accidents.”

The road widened further. As they got closer to the Principality of Renosa, Instructor Alan, who had been leading the students on the journey, spoke with relief.

Despite his furrowed brows, there was a hint of relief in his eyes.

He was the person in charge of this group. Once they entered Renosa, they would be under the management of the tournament organizers. His job would become slightly easier.

Most of the Greta Academy students were of noble birth. The journey was prepared to match that standard.

Though it wasn’t luxurious, it was made sure to be comfortable. It wasn’t a task Alan was familiar with.

“We’ll be able to rest once we arrive.”

Instructor Patricia, who had maintained her poise until now, winked and touched his shoulder.

Instructor Alan looked at her with gentle eyes.

In any case, it was thanks to the dean’s consideration that the two of them were traveling together.

Professor Luxen coughed for no apparent reason.

“Ahem! it seems there’s something up ahead.”

He pointed ahead, having scanned the area with a short-range detection spell.

Indeed, there was something ahead. No hostility was felt.

The group was nearing Renosa’s territory. It was likely that those who had come to greet them had received advance notice.

Having sent word that they would arrive today, it was likely they had come to meet them.

The group approached with caution, prepared for any eventuality.

Soon, the figures came into view. They were well-trained elite soldiers.

Lined up along the roadside, they were motionless and exuded a stifling military discipline.

They gave off the impression of swords honed solely for cutting down enemies. Each one was highly skilled.

Black armor. Emblazoned with wings and a sword. The moment they saw them, everyone except Helmut knew who they were.

“The Black Wing Knights of Renosa?”

“They’re here… this is too much just to greet us.”

Nils murmured. Helmut recalled what he knew about the Black Wing Knights of Renosa.

Among the many pieces of information he had gathered, there was information about the Black Wing Knights.

They were one of the few knight orders that could be said to be on par with the Palma Knights of Basor.

While less rough and more refined than the Palma Knights, their skill was comparable.

In one-on-one combat, they might even be better than the Palma Knights.

Renosa had almost no demonic beasts, and these knights fought humans.

Even though Renosa was putting a lot of effort into this swordsmanship tournament, having the Grand Duke’s direct Black Wing Knights to greet the Greta Academy members was excessive.

They likely didn’t greet all the academy groups this way.

Was it a coincidence?

Charlotte’s face noticeably hardened upon seeing them.

‘Why are the Black Wing Knights here… could it be His Highness the Grand Duke?’

As the carriage reached the impressive presence of the knights, one of the Black Wing Knights stepped forward.

With a loud neigh, the carriage came to a halt.

A calm voice rang out.

“We received word that you would be passing through here today. Welcome, members of Greta Academy. I am Karl Vanto of the Black Wing Knights.”

It wasn’t a situation typically warranting the appearance of the Knights’ Commander or Deputy Commander.

But it was clear from his demeanor that he was of considerable rank.

“What brings you out here?”

It wasn’t a greeting for dignitaries. The members of Greta Academy knew they weren’t considered dignitaries.

There were more than just one or two Black Wing Knights. There were dozens of them.

“We are here to escort you to your destination. This is the will of the Grand Duchy of Renosa.”

Charlotte knew who the man in front of her was. She detected subtlety in his words.

He didn’t say it was the will of His Highness the Grand Duke. That meant…

In any case, he did not greet Charlotte directly.

‘Not yet…’

Charlotte closed her eyes slowly, then opened them. She knew there was a high chance she would be revealed despite the academy’s policy.

The faculty also knew who Charlotte was.

But Charlotte felt relieved that it wouldn’t happen immediately. She did not want to reveal her identity. She fervently wished not to.

Maybe it was because she enjoyed the time she spent with the Greta Academy members.

At Greta Academy, Charlotte could just be Charlotte.

A diligent and talented student, liked by everyone. Not a worthless being hated by her brother and ignored by her mother. She didn’t want to destroy that.

Instructor Alan guessed why they had come this far.

“We appreciate the generous treatment. We take it as encouragement to achieve excellent results.”

“And there is one other matter to address.”

His tone suggested it was not so much a request as a statement of something that must obviously be done, almost like a command.

Karl Vanto shifted his gaze to Charlotte.

“The Grand Duchy of Renosa wishes to meet with Miss Charlotte.”

His expression and tone were respectful.

“Would you accompany us?”

Everyone turned to look at Charlotte. Her complexion wavered as if she had been counterattacked.

She knew who wanted to see her.

She hadn’t expected Michael to be able to move the Grand Duke’s direct Black Wing Knights.

‘Is he trying to show me that he has control over the Black Wing Knights?’

The Grand Duke wasn’t a puppet, so it wouldn’t be complete control.

But it was clear Michael had been granted such authority.

Karl Vanto asked Charlotte again, his tone slightly troubled.

“Would you come with us?”

It was an invitation to Charlotte, not a demand to the Greta Academy faculty.

Karl Vanto didn’t bow or lower himself. It wasn’t a request for consent.

His attitude was subtly high-handed. Slightly unpleasant.

But the faculty didn’t point it out.

They were dealing with the Black Wing Knights of Renosa. There was nothing to gain by clashing with them here. They were here to compete.

“It would be difficult for her to act alone, but since Charlotte’s hometown is Renosa, it shouldn’t be a problem.”

In a tone that seemed to grant permission, Instructor Patricia stepped back.

Instructor Alan agreed. But he added one condition.

“Charlotte, what do you think?”

“I want to go.”

There was no intention to avoid it. She would face it.

Determination filled Charlotte’s eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 217 (Part 1):
				“If that’s what you wish.”

Instructor Alan replied with a cautious expression. Just because the other person was the Grand Princess of Renosa and they were in Renosa didn’t mean the situation would change immediately.

Charlotte was still a student of Greta Academy. He treated her as such, which was also what Charlotte wanted.

“However, even though we are in Renosa, we can’t allow you to act alone for long, so please return to the accommodation by at least tomorrow.”

Instructor Patricia added to Instructor Alan’s request.

“Will you be able to do that?”

“Of course.”

Karl Vanto answered calmly.

“Then.”

Charlotte slightly bowed her head to the faculty.

Professor Luxen stroked his chin as he looked at her, and Instructor Patricia had a troubled expression.

This was the first time they had encountered such a situation.

Visiting a student’s country and having a knight order take the student away!

Of course, there would be no issue with safety. It was a situation difficult to refuse.

There was a brief murmuring among the group.

Leon and Nils looked at each other. Confusion was evident on their faces.

Helmut observed the situation silently. It wasn’t that he wasn’t curious. But it seemed he would soon find out.

Karl Vanto, raising his eyebrows, concluded cleanly.

“Then, Miss Charlotte, please follow me. The rest of you will be safely escorted by the Black Wing Knights.”

The Greta Academy group thus joined the Black Wing Knights. Charlotte, however, followed Karl Vanto to the prepared carriage.

Karl Vanto’s attitude changed once they were sufficiently distanced from the Greta Academy group.

As Charlotte boarded the carriage, Karl Vanto bowed his head to her. It was a knightly salute.

“Please forgive my rudeness, Your Highness.”

“No, thank you for following the academy’s policies. So, is Michael looking for me?”

Even with the Black Wing Knights coming, she didn’t think the Grand Duke would be looking for her.

If it were the Grand Duke, he would formally invite her instead of arranging such a troublesome meeting. Even if he was Charlotte’s father.

Karl Vanto wasn’t familiar to Charlotte either.

However, the Black Wing Knights themselves were not unfamiliar to her.

Not because she was the Grand Princess of Renosa, but because she had been taught swordsmanship by the commander of the Black Wing Knights.

Michael had intensely envied that fact. Because even swinging a sword for an hour left him bedridden the next day due to his weak body.

Moreover, his talent for swordsmanship was mediocre.

Even though they were born on the same day, their talents in swordsmanship couldn’t even be compared.

Karl Vanto nodded.

“Yes, he wishes to see you as soon as possible. Therefore, we came to welcome the Greta Academy group under that pretext.”

Charlotte asked for confirmation.

“Does Michael have the authority to move the Black Wing Knights?”

“After returning from Basor, at the request of the Grand Duchess, he was allowed to accompany some of us. However, the personnel here moved under a specific pretext.”

“So, my mother… did that.”

Even the Grand Duke could not ignore the words of the Grand Duchess. The simplest way for Michael to get what he wanted was through his mother.

Without hesitation, their mother had given many things to her frail young son, disregarding Charlotte’s presence.

As if she had only one child. As if the heir’s position naturally belonged to Michael.

It left a bitter taste in her mouth. It was a familiar yet never fully acceptable fact.

With a firm expression, Charlotte left one request.

“Treat my group the same as the other academy representatives. Don’t think of giving them special treatment just because I’m here. This is a fair competition.”

It was a straightforward request. She herself felt uncomfortable about being separated alone to meet Michael.

No matter how much this was Renosa and the semester was ending, Charlotte was still part of Greta Academy.

“Understood, Your Highness.”

Karl Vanto responded calmly. Charlotte, without saying another word, got into the carriage.

She planned to rejoin her group after her business was done.



H.F.C Chapter 217 (Part 2):
				After a brief journey, the carriage stopped in front of an elegant mansion on the outskirts of a village.

Charlotte recognized the place.

It was a villa of the Grand Duchy of Renosa.

Even though she had prepared herself, as she was led inside, she felt an inexplicable tension. A maid guided her.

“This way. Prince Michael has prepared a meal.”

She was indeed hungry. Although she doubted she could eat with Michael in front of her.

Creak.

As the door opened, her eyes brightened. A delicious aroma quickly filled her nostrils. At the same time, a voice greeted her.

“Welcome, Charlotte. It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”

A friendly and soft voice echoed. Charlotte stiffened as she looked at him.

With the sunlight pouring through the window behind him, Michael sat at a marble table, his chin resting on his hand, looking angelic.

The smile on the face of the blond boy with lake-like blue eyes was as if drawn.

Charlotte responded calmly.

“It’s been a while, Michael.”

“Have a seat. I’ve prepared your favorite dishes.”

The meal, centered around light and clean seafood dishes, matched her taste surprisingly well after the first bite.

Receiving such treatment, it would be hard for anyone not to fall for him.

Michael knew Charlotte’s preferences and habits meticulously, even though he disliked her.

It was his nature. Observing people, distinguishing likes and dislikes, and trying to win and use their hearts.

Michael had never tried to win Charlotte’s heart. If he had wanted to, it wouldn’t have been impossible.

“Why did you call me?”

Charlotte asked in a flat tone. She couldn’t tell from the letter, but being here made it clear.

This was an omen of malice. Michael always acted overly friendly before revealing his malice.

She didn’t feel particularly disappointed anew.

Charlotte remained composed, and Michael’s smile deepened as he watched her.

“I wanted to show some consideration for my sister, who must have been having messy meals at inns on her way back to Renosa. Please, go ahead and eat.”

Charlotte ate. She didn’t storm out because she knew that would lead to more trouble.

If Michael was trying to tame her.

Charlotte was a member of the Grand Duchy of Renosa. She couldn’t live ignoring him forever. In a way, he was someone Charlotte had to endure.

As Michael watched Charlotte eat, without lifting a finger himself, he asked nonchalantly.

“How is life at the academy?”

Wouldn’t he feel bitter if she said she was doing well? After all, it was something Michael could only dream of.

But Charlotte didn’t lie.

“It’s going well.”

“I heard you’re the top first-year in the swordsmanship department. Seeing that you’ve come to Renosa as part of the Greta Academy group, you must be doing well. It seems your skills are recognized at the academy. But…”

Michael made an insinuating remark.

“It’s a bit strange that you became one of Gretna Academy’s selectees. Apparently the originally selected person had to give it up? Your resourcefulness is impressive.”

At the subtle insinuation, Charlotte put on a stern expression.

“It’s not about my resourcefulness. It was that person’s choice.”

“Can you confidently say you did nothing to influence that choice?”

Michael was suggesting that Asuka gave up for Charlotte’s sake, and Charlotte intended that.

He liked to attach causes to the results of everything. Especially misinterpreting Charlotte’s intentions.

“Instead of this kind of talk, just tell me what you really want to say. Why did you call me out like this? You could have quietly summoned me.”

“Now I see why you’re upset. You don’t want them to know you’re the Grand Princess of Renosa? Do you like life at the academy that much?”

Michael laughed. Charlotte stood up abruptly.

But she wasn’t good at verbal jabs or sarcasm. Instead, she had become more decisive.

Not seeing Michael for a while had been good medicine. Charlotte spoke firmly.

“I’m glad to see you’re doing well. I’m leaving now.”

As she tried to leave, Michael’s tone changed.

“Sit down.”

It was a high-handed tone. Michael didn’t speak to anyone else that way. Except for Charlotte.

“Unless you want me to tell them that you are the Grand Princess of Renosa.”

“They’ll find out eventually.”

“They might not. If you finish your meal and return, I’ll keep it a secret. Until your group leaves Renosa, they won’t know.”

“It doesn’t matter if they find out.”

“Do you think the only harm I can cause you is just that?”

Michael opened his eyes wide as if in disbelief.

The swordsmanship tournament was hosted in Renosa. Subtly disadvantaging the Greta Academy wouldn’t be difficult.

In fact, it had always been so in previous comprehensive swordsmanship tournaments.

That’s why Basor’s martial arts tournament, where everything was fair, was famous.

Charlotte clenched her fist.

She was surprised at herself for wanting to hit him.

There were guards, but it would only take a moment for Charlotte to take Michael down.

Michael wouldn’t be able to resist. Yet he sat there without any protection.

As if knowing Charlotte wouldn’t do that. His confidence was unsettling.

Michael changed his tone quickly.

“I want to hear something from you.”

Charlotte asked while still standing.

“What do you want to hear?”

Michael smiled naturally.

“About the selected students of Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department? I heard there are some interesting stories from Greta Academy.”

“They are all excellent. I am the least skilled among the selected. So I want to go back and focus on training.”

Michael seemed ready to get to the main point. Words flowed smoothly from his mouth.

“Indeed. But I heard there’s a commoner among your group. It’s surprising. It’s not easy for a commoner to outperform nobles at the academy.”

He frowned slightly and asked.

“Is his name… Helmut?”

The moment Michael mentioned Helmut’s name, an eerie chill rushed over her. It wasn’t a good sign.

Charlotte tried to regain her composure.

“Yes. Senior Helmut is known as a commoner and is the top second-year in the swordsmanship department.”

Was Michael trying to recruit Helmut?

It was possible. As a commoner, he wouldn’t have a fixed allegiance, and Helmut had the talent.

The Black Wing Knights of Renosa were a haven for skilled knights and offered good treatment.

No matter how much Charlotte was against it, she couldn’t take that opportunity away from Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 218 (Part 1):
				‘Senior Helmut doesn’t seem like someone who would fit into the Black Wing Knights.’

For some reason, Charlotte felt that way. His presence was too intense to be confined to any organization.

Michael asked subtly.

“Who among the Greta Academy representatives has the most outstanding skills?”

But before Charlotte could answer, Michael found the answer in her brief hesitation.

“It’s Helmut, isn’t it? Amazing, especially since he’s a commoner. He’s more skilled than even the senior students? And he’s gained your favor.”

Michael’s eyes gleamed with a peculiar light. Charlotte felt a stirring unease.

Now that she thought about it, Helmut knew her mother’s maiden name. She didn’t know how that fact might connect with Michael, but it felt uncomfortable.

She had a premonition that these two should not be connected in any way.

“Could it be you’re interested in him as a man? The commoner, I mean.”

“No.”

Charlotte cut him off firmly. Even though nobles and commoners were treated equally within the academy, that wasn’t the case outside of it.

For the Grand Princess of Renosa to harbor feelings for a commoner would be an inability to understand her position.
