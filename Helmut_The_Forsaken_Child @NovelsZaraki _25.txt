Even Michael, who hopes Charlotte lowers herself, would not accept such a thing.

“He’s a diligent and skilled senior. If you want to recruit him, do as you wish. Senior Helmut is impeccable as a knight.”

Charlotte answered as fairly as possible. She didn’t want Michael to hold any ill will against Helmut because of her.

For a commoner like Helmut, the enmity of Renosa’s heir would be too much to handle.

But she soon realized that describing Helmut as an impeccable knight did not quite fit him.

Charlotte had heard how Helmut dealt with a second-year student who had provoked him.

From what she could see, Helmut was not the type to be docile or obedient to anyone.

He should not be involved with someone like Michael. Michael was the type to get what he wanted, which meant they were bound to clash.

Michael shrugged lightly.

“Well, talent isn’t exclusive to Greta Academy. I’ll keep your words in mind.”

Charlotte added firmly.

“Even if His Highness granted you rights over the Black Wing Knights, it’s meant to protect you. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t flaunt it like this.”

Sending the Black Wing Knights was a way for Michael to show off the authority he had gained as an heir.

But the name of the Black Wing Knights was too significant to be used for such purposes.

Also, this way of doing things that she couldn’t refuse was unpleasant.

The mere act of the Black Wing Knights coming en masse to take Charlotte could make others suspicious of her identity.

Though the faculty already knew, it would be difficult to dispel the doubts of the other selected students.

Even though Michael promised to keep it secret, he didn’t guarantee it unconditionally.

Michael’s lips curled into a smile. A cold smile that only Charlotte could see, despite his angelic face.

“That’s my right. Something you don’t have. And I will gain even more in the future. Things you won’t be able to have.”

“Whatever you gain has nothing to do with me.”

“It does have to do with you. By the time you graduate from Greta Academy, you will be kneeling at my feet as a vassal of Renosa.”

Michael was openly wary of other heirs of Renosa.

If he was saying this to establish hierarchy, it meant he wasn’t yet intent on eliminating Charlotte.

If he wanted to eliminate her, it would be better to win her over and make her lower her guard.

But Charlotte never forgot that Michael could turn on her at any moment.

“If you can, do so. By fair means.”

She couldn’t help but dislike his methods, which involved even using their mother.

Sometimes, weakness can be a weapon. Michael knew how to use that well.

Yet, he also had the talent to win everyone’s favor.

That was his greatest talent, surpassing Charlotte’s talent with the sword.

Charlotte’s meal had ended at some point. Michael, who hadn’t touched his food, changed his smile.

He looked at Charlotte with an unreadable expression and spoke.

“I’m glad to see you’re the same as ever. Let’s meet again.”

He waved lightly. As Charlotte stood up, she left a parting remark.

“You haven’t changed either.”

She had no choice but to act as Michael intended once she came this far.

Even though she had tried to remain composed, she couldn’t help but feel emotional.

‘I hope senior Helmut won’t get into trouble because of…this.’

Charlotte hoped Michael wouldn’t take an interest in him.

Michael would be busy. Successfully hosting the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament in Renosa was his task.

At least he wouldn’t cause immediate trouble, which was fortunate.



H.F.C Chapter 218 (Part 2):
				“Cinus.”

As soon as Charlotte left, Michael called out.

Cinus appeared like a shadow and stood before Michael.

“Yes, Your Highness.”

“What did you think of Charlotte?”

“She seems unchanged.”

“Right? I thought so too. Good.”

Michael smiled. Unlike the smile he showed Charlotte, this one gave a pure impression.

Of course, purity wasn’t a word that suited Michael.

He tapped his forehead and fell into deep thought.

Charlotte has not changed. Her unambitious nature remains the same.

Despite attending the academy, she hadn’t developed any new ambitions. He had worried about that.

Michael only had one kind of ambition to be wary of: ambition for the position of Renosa’s heir.

Observing Charlotte was important to Michael. She was the only competitor who could take what he had.

Michael was more wary of her than Charlotte realized.

Without Michael, who would oppose Charlotte becoming the heir of Renosa?

She had everything Michael lacked: health, a proper character, and excellent swordsmanship.

Especially the first, which was why the Grand Duke hadn’t readily handed over all authority to Michael.

There was always doubt whether he was sturdy enough to uphold Renosa.

‘Even if I’ve gotten better, I’ll never be healthy enough to wield a sword.’

He still fell ill at least one day a week. But Michael was certain.

‘Even so, Charlotte won’t be able to beat me.’

Michael was superior in securing what he wanted.

Charlotte wasn’t even aiming for the heir’s position. She would accept it only if it were given to her.

As long as Charlotte didn’t confront him or defy their mother, the heir’s position was his.

Michael had to continuously remind her of this. He would be the master of Renosa, and Charlotte would have to support him.

Michael did feel jealousy towards Charlotte, but he also considered her family.

They were twins. His only sister. The bond from birth couldn’t be ignored.

Michael’s actions were always calculated. Although his actions towards Charlotte sometimes lacked calculation, even those emotional actions and words were because Charlotte was special.

Michael never forgot that if Charlotte were an ally, she would be the most reliable sword.

The most trustworthy loyal sword. She would be a good knight.

Michael finished his thoughts and asked.

“How did the investigations go? Cinus.”

“Here is the list of selected students from each academy.”

Michael received the thick documents Cinus handed over. The documents did not contain appearances.

It was impressive to gather this much. Baden’s academies were particularly strict about protecting student information.

After flipping through the documents for a while, Michael wore a bored expression and asked.

“Is he among them? Hyde.”

“He’s skilled enough to be selected. But there’s no one named Hyde on the list.”

“He participated in Basor’s martial arts tournament for a purpose. So he might not participate in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, even if he’s skilled. He’s hiding his skills.”

“He’s too skilled to be learning at an academy.”

The voice was laced with doubt. If he was the winner of Basor’s martial arts tournament, he should be teaching, not learning.

He must have a purpose for attending the academy, likely to hide himself.

“But he’s attending an academy. And he must be standing out to some extent.”

He must be achieving excellent results. Michael felt Hyde wouldn’t tolerate being at the bottom, even if he hid his skills.

Could a commoner be that stubborn? He must be a noble.

That was Michael’s judgment.

He thought Hyde was attending an academy in Baden, but he ordered a thorough search of all academies just in case.

Cinus reported his findings.

“Based on what I’ve found, there’s no one named Hyde resembling him across all academies.”

“Of course. He must be using an alias. And perhaps a disguise…”

Michael tried to recall Hyde’s appearance. Once Michael decided to pursue something, he didn’t let go easily.

He had diligently pursued Hyde, despite Hyde leaving almost no trace. There had just been some challenges along the way.

Michael pondered and nodded.

“He must have used a disguise to vanish so cleanly.”

With such a noticeable appearance, it wouldn’t be easy to evade tracking unless he looked completely different.

“He used an artifact. Most likely one that changes appearance.”

“Right, so the question is whether he’s participating in this comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.”

Michael raised an eyebrow.

“If I see his sword, I’ll recognize him, no matter what he looks like.”

It was the swordsmanship of the Sword Saint Darien. He had already eliminated one person because of it. The only question was whether Hyde had brought that sword with him.

“He wouldn’t know you’re here. So he might not avoid the tournament.”

“Right? I hope so.”

Michael’s eyes narrowed.

“More than that, this commoner Helmut…”



H.F.C Chapter 219 (Part 1):
				“We don’t have much information on him. Black hair, black eyes, a cold and aloof demeanor. He transferred in as a second-year student and took the top spot. He’s a boy who receives the support of an instructor and is quite respected at Greta Academy.

Nothing is known about his past before entering the academy. It’s also unknown who taught him the sword. The most notable thing is that he’s very handsome.”

At that moment, the name that flashed through Michael’s mind was Hyde.

Hyde was also very handsome. With such looks, it would be no wonder he would cause a stir both inside and outside the academy. Unless he was in disguise.

Michael shook his head.

‘Helmut is a commoner.’

His judgment wouldn’t be wrong.

Hyde was too dignified to be a commoner. A commoner couldn’t possess such a character.

No matter how strong they are, a commoner must learn to obey nobles from birth throughout their life.

The consciousness cultivated from a young age is not easily overcome.

Hyde maintained his dignified attitude even though he knew Michael was no ordinary noble.

“Charlotte has quite a picky personality. She’s upright and can’t tolerate anything unjust or unreasonable. If she acknowledges him, it’s worth paying attention to.”

They were fellow students at the same academy. Although there was a difference in grade, they could be quite close.

Would Helmut then become Charlotte’s weakness? Michael quickly thought it through.

Perhaps he could be. Even if it’s not a romantic feeling, Charlotte would never tolerate someone from the same academy getting hurt because of her.

But there’s no need to provoke Charlotte like that yet.

He didn’t want to make Charlotte draw her sword.

Michael concluded simply.

“Would you like to visit the Greta Academy group? If you wish, I can arrange a meeting.”

“I am the one hosting the tournament in Renosa. If that becomes known, the fairness of the tournament could be questioned, so I cannot do that. Let me make it clear, I have no intention of watching from afar either. I am not that idle. I will see Helmut at the tournament. There’s still plenty of time.”

Michael smiled, thinking about the upcoming stage.

It was a task entrusted to him by the Grand Duke. It was a test as a successor.

Michael received the rights to the Black Wing Knights not only because of his mother’s request but also because he was hosting the tournament.

He doesn’t expect Charlotte, a mere first-year student, to show anything remarkable in the swordsmanship tournament.

He only needed to perform the task given by the Grand Duke admirably. That was to successfully host the swordsmanship tournament.

‘I have an inexplicable premonition.’

But that premonition would surely work to his advantage. Michael was confident.

*

Although they had not yet reached the capital of Renosa, the Greta Academy group arrived at a luxurious mansion.

The mansion was as splendid as that of a grand noble, from the chandeliers to the wallpaper and furniture, all of which were things only the owner of an exceptional mansion would cherish.

Renosa was a wealthy nation. Such treatment would not burden them.

However, considering that their guests were not a delegation but the Greta Academy group coming for the tournament, it was somewhat excessive.

Most of the group, who were nobles, accepted the luxury without burden but recognized the excess.

“Everyone, take a rest!”

After the faculty left, only the students remained.

“It’s a luxury hard to enjoy at Greta Academy.”

Before entering the room, Nils murmured. Helmut was the only one he could talk to.

Charlotte hadn’t returned yet, and Leon had been silent since his duel with Helmut, leaving quickly as soon as the faculty left, as if it was dangerous to be alone with Helmut without the faculty.

“Yeah.”

Helmut answered indifferently. He thought the interior of the mansion was somewhat dazzling.

The Ethan Kudrow mansion was not shabby, but the splendor here was unusual.

Especially the furniture decorated with gold leaf and jewels. The rooms seen through the open doors were similarly splendid.

“Maybe it’s because of Charlotte? Upon arrival, they’ll receive similar treatment to the others, but this mansion… this is not provided to everyone.

I don’t know if it’s the original treatment for participants in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament, but there wouldn’t be many mansions like this. No matter how wealthy Renosa is.”

It was unlikely this lodging was prepared as compensation for taking Greta Academy students away.

They could rest in such a mansion thanks to Charlotte. Because they were Charlotte’s group. They couldn’t give special treatment only to Charlotte.

This place was said to be the villa of the Grand Duke of Renosa.

“If the Grand Duke lends his villa, what kind of person is Charlotte?”

“Who knows.”

He had his guesses. But he wasn’t sure.



H.F.C Chapter 219 (Part 2):
				Nils continued speaking persistently.

“She seems to be close to you. You must have encountered her a lot since the first and second-years sometimes sparred together. Haven’t you heard anything?”

“Charlotte strictly adheres to the academy’s policy.”

“So she hasn’t revealed her status?”

“All I know is that she is from Renosa.”

“A simple noble girl from Renosa wouldn’t be sought out by the Grand Duke’s Black Wing Knights. The one she meets must at least be a member of the Grand Duke’s family. A direct descendant of the Grand Duke, or maybe even the Grand Duke himself. It would take that much to mobilize the Black Wing Knights.”

“I suppose so.”

“Why does the Grand Duke’s family want to see Charlotte? How old is the Grand Duke’s heir? I heard he’s around her age.”

Nils had vaguely heard rumors about Michael.

He was said to be very intelligent and beautiful but frail, the heir of Renosa.

Nils suddenly had a wild guess.

‘Could Charlotte be the fiancée of the Grand Duke’s heir?’

If so, such privileges wouldn’t be strange. The Renosa family is also famous for swordsmanship.

Having a prestigious knightly order like the Black Wing Knights means they value martial prowess.

A noble girl as talented as Charlotte could support the frail Grand Duke’s heir.

Helmut focused on something else.

“So there’s an heir to the Grand Duke in Renosa.”

If it was known that there was an heir, it would also be known if there was an heiress.

Then Charlotte is not the Grand Duke’s heiress. It was a bit confusing.

Helmut had thought Charlotte might be the Grand Duke’s heiress.

“I think I’ve heard something like that. In fact, little is known about the Renosa Grand Duke’s family. The Renosa family is close to the royal family. They interact only with high-ranking nobles, and their births and other personal details are kept secret. Especially since Renosa is far from the Empire, even those from the Empire know little.”

Many at the academy were from the Empire. But none of them knew about Charlotte.

Information about the direct line of the Renosa Grand Duke’s family was almost secret. Even nobles from Renosa didn’t know much.

Especially since Charlotte neglected social activities, her existence was not well known.

Only Michael, who was active publicly, was somewhat known.

Most nobles interacted for social purposes.

But that also varied by noble. Even noble children often didn’t show their faces outside their families until they debuted in society as adults.

There were few chances for others to know about them unless they directly interacted with other families.

Renosa, with its royal bloodline, was an exceptionally closed family.

Renosa was a secretive duchy. They ensured that what happened inside didn’t go beyond the walls.

Michael was also frail, and his existence had only recently become known because he was expected to die young when he was younger.

“There must be some issue with the Grand Duke’s family. Since marrying an imperial consort, their activities have been unusually quiet.”

Nils, who had been frowning, quickly closed his mouth. He was conscious of a passing maid.

This was Renosa. Speaking recklessly about the Grand Duke’s family could be considered blasphemy.

Helmut listened closely to Nils talking about the Renosa Grand Duke’s family.

“Charlotte could be a collateral relative of the Grand Duke’s family. Renosa values swordsmen, so the Grand Duke could have noticed her talent. Although Asuka refused to participate and she came instead, it’s not easy for a first-year to beat a third-year and be selected as a representative.”

Nils murmured and shook his head.

“No, forget what I said. Considering the academy’s policies, if she doesn’t wish to be known, it’s best to leave it be.”

As a sixth-year, Nils showed maturity. Though curious, he believed he shouldn’t pry.

All the faculty kept silent as well.

“Alright.”

Helmut entered his room. It seemed he needed to think a bit.

Charlotte returned that evening.

It was just when they were being served a meal together.

The meal was as grand as the mansion.

Enough to soothe their travel-weary bodies. Charlotte immediately bowed as she entered the dining room.

“I apologize for acting alone.”

“There’s no need. You had permission.”

“Yes, have a seat.”

Instructor Patricia smiled warmly, in stark contrast to her attitude towards Asuka, following Instructor Alan’s lead.

Everyone had relaxed, thanks to the excellent treatment despite the high-handed attitude of the Black Wing Knights.

After all, they entered the mansion under the escort of the Black Wing Knights, a privilege only VIPs enjoyed. It could be seen positively.

“Coming to Renosa was a good decision. You can boast about it when we return.”

Instructor Patricia murmured. Charlotte, looking around, asked.

“Is the meal to your liking?”

Charlotte, who spoke like a host, quickly realized her mistake and shut her mouth.

In Renosa, she used to greet guests with her mother.

Renosa was her family’s domain. Here, she wasn’t supposed to greet academy people, which led to the slip.

The few academy peers from Renosa had been sternly warned to keep quiet about her.

Though it seemed like something had leaked.

Instructor Patricia acted nonchalantly.

The faculty knew that Charlotte was the Grand Duke’s daughter.

“Yes, it’s wonderful. To think we’d receive such lavish treatment in Renosa. Charlotte, would you join us?”

Charlotte had already eaten but nodded to join them.

She was in the swordsmanship department. She could eat more if she wanted.



H.F.C Chapter 220 (Part 1):
				The Grand Duke’s heir of Renosa returned, leading the Black Wing Knights.

It felt as if a storm was sweeping through Renosa’s palace. That was the presence of Michael in this place.

“Inform my mother that I have returned.”

His soft voice resonated. It was the gentle voice of a prince, kind even to his own servants.

There was no one in the palace who did not obey that gentle voice.

“Yes, Your Highness Michael.”

The maid blushed and quickly hurried inside.

Michael moved with a smile still etched on his face. Shortly after he stepped inside, a woman appeared from the other side.

She was a beautiful woman in a dress with a crown on her head. Her steps were quick yet elegant as she approached.

She was a noblewoman who seemed to have been born with the word ‘dignity’ ingrained in her entire being.

The mistress of Renosa, Grand Duchess Margret. She approached Michael with a relieved expression.

“Oh, Michael!”

She urgently embraced him with both arms as if she had found a lost child.

“You have been ill recently, and yet you’ve traveled such a long way. Are you feeling alright?”

“Yes, I’m fine. Perhaps the sunlight in Basor helped, I feel healthier.”

Michael replied with an innocent face.

“But let’s talk inside.”

Michael’s eyes swept over the servants who bowed their heads.

While there was nothing wrong with showing that the Grand Duchess and her son had a good relationship, she treated Michael excessively like a child. It was almost excessive.

Michael was young but he was to become the master of Renosa. It wasn’t good for the servants to see him as a child.

However, the fact that she treated him like a child also meant that the Grand Duchess cared deeply for Michael.

Everything had its pros and cons. And Michael knew how to handle those cons.

The Grand Duchess promptly nodded.

“Let’s do that. Would you like to have some tea? Are you not hungry?”

“I’m fine with food for now. Having tea and chatting with you after so long sounds nice.”

His voice was like a balm, and his smile was refreshing.

Michael knew that if they dined together, his mother would be anxious to feed him more, which could lead to indigestion.

The enchanted Grand Duchess entered the parlor with Michael.

The two of them enjoyed a private conversation over tea.

“So, did you meet Charlotte well?”

“Yes, she’s the same as always.”

“Did you clear up the misunderstanding? Charlotte thinks you’re avoiding her.”

She spoke with a concerned tone, as if it couldn’t possibly be true. Margret always thought positively of Michael’s every action.

This time, it was true. Even though it twisted his insides that Charlotte had entered Baden’s prestigious academy, a place he couldn’t go and where she was now out of his reach.

Michael smiled lightly.

“Of course. I welcomed Charlotte with the Black Wing Knights. It was a special courtesy to the Grand Duchess. Charlotte deserves such treatment. Although I might get scolded by the Grand Duke for it, I believe Charlotte will appreciate my sincerity.”

Michael spoke with a smile, carefully packaging his words. Though, of course, he had other intentions.

Charlotte had precisely seen through Michael’s motive for bringing the Black Wing Knights, but his mother had not.

Margret laughed happily.

“Oh, that’s wonderful. Charlotte will be pleased. It would have been even better if the commander of the Black Wing Knights went personally. He’s her mentor, after all.”

Margret was certainly not foolish. She was the Grand Duchess of Renosa. The position beside the Grand Duke, who ruled the duchy, was not one a foolish or lacking woman could hold.

But somehow, when it came to Michael, it was as if something blinded her, and her thinking rapidly narrowed.

She wouldn’t think beyond the explanation Michael had given about why he met Charlotte with the Black Wing Knights.

“Yes, but if he had moved, Greta Academy might have been suspicious.”

That was not the only reason. How could one who needed to be separated be kept close?

The commander of the Black Wing Knights subtly supported Charlotte despite her lack of interest in the heir position.

The reason was simple. Michael wasn’t a swordsman.

The commander of the Black Wing Knights was a man who could only lean toward Charlotte, who had excellent swordsmanship talent, rather than Michael, who couldn’t wield a sword.

Michael had no complaint about that. He should not. For it was the duty of Renosa’s master to handle even such people.

However, a cold light flashed in Michael’s eyes.

After a brief silence, during which Margret sipped her tea, she continued.

“Charlotte will probably come back too. She won’t be able to return to the palace until the tournament is over, so make sure she doesn’t lack anything.”

“I will do my best. Though I’m worried that her identity as the Grand Duchess might be revealed. Charlotte doesn’t want that. It’s the academy’s policy, she says.”

Charlotte wouldn’t receive any special treatment. Michael intended to leave her alone for now. It would be problematic if she achieved excellent results in the swordsmanship tournament.

Michael didn’t really mind if Charlotte’s identity as the Grand Duchess was revealed.

The faculty would know, and while the few representatives from Greta Academy might not know, even if they found out, what could they do? They would just have to keep their mouths shut.

‘If it becomes known that Charlotte is the Grand Duchess of Renosa, there will be those who flock to her. It would be troublesome if she builds forces.’

Michael briefly worried.

“Just a first-year at the academy, yet chosen as a representative to come to Renosa. It’s something I couldn’t even dream of… Charlotte is truly remarkable. I feel like she’s drifting farther away from me.”

As Michael showed a bitter expression, the Grand Duchess quickly grabbed his hand.

“Oh, Michael, you’re doing well here in Renosa. You don’t have to think like that. When Charlotte returns, she’ll be by your side.”

‘Not by my side, but beneath me.’

Michael thought leisurely as he looked at his mother.



H.F.C Chapter 220 (Part 2):
				“Yes, I should do well in Renosa. I must also successfully conclude this swordsmanship tournament.”

“I worry about the heavy responsibilities the Grand Duke has placed on you. I fear for your health.”

“It’s an opportunity to gain the Grand Duke’s recognition. I am the heir of Renosa. It’s my duty.”

The Grand Duke was not a father but the Grand Duke. While he called his mother ‘mother’, he never called his father ‘father’.

The Grand Duke was such an existence. Before being a father, he was the master of the duchy.

Ironically, he was a husband to Margret. If there was anyone who could move the Grand Duke, it was this beautiful noblewoman. Michael knew this well.

The stern father had no choice but to grant Michael the privilege of the Black Wing Knights due to her persuasion.

However, the Grand Duke was not easily swayed.

After listening to a few more of Margret’s worried words, Michael left the parlor and headed straight to the Grand Duke’s study.

First, to his mother, then to the Grand Duke. This was the set order.

“Please enter, Your Highness Michael.”

“I come before Your Highness, the glory of Renosa.”

Michael bowed his head as he entered the office.

The man in the room, backlit by the light, lifted his head.

The pressure was like a mountain crashing down. The gaze that fell upon him was so intense it felt like it could pierce through.

Facing those jet-black eyes, Michael lowered his head.

The Grand Duke of Renosa. With black hair and black eyes, he was still handsome and youthful enough that there was no need to recall his younger days.

His gaze and charisma were fitting for a ruler.

The Grand Duke of Renosa was known as the Iron-Blooded Grand Duke.

As soon as Michael finished his greeting, the Grand Duke spoke coldly.

“Yes, I know you cannot be a lion. But you must know that a fox cannot become the master of Renosa!”

The Grand Duke of Renosa was an exceptional swordsman. His words, filled with authority and power, often overwhelmed others.

Even Michael was no exception to feeling intimidated in his presence.

But Michael managed to smile. He knew he couldn’t show weakness in front of the Grand Duke.

“You are displeased that I mobilized the Black Wing Knights.”

“Only the master of Renosa can command the Black Wing Knights. You do not have that right.”

“I understand.”

“The swordsmanship tournament is imminent. Focus solely on that while you’re in the capital. The Black Wing Knights will not follow you outside the capital.”

“I will keep that in mind.”

Michael responded obediently. Conversations with the Grand Duke were always one-sided.

The Grand Duke never asked about the well-being of Charlotte or Michael. He was someone lacking in parental affection.

Still, if he had to choose, the Grand Duke favored Charlotte. She resembled him more, and although she lacked tact, she had outstanding talent in swordsmanship.

Charlotte was a true swordsman. The Grand Duke liked swordsmen.

Compared to her, Michael was an unsatisfactory child. Though his son, he did not resemble the Grand Duke at all.

Cunning, frail, and lacking in talent with the sword.

However, the Grand Duke recognized Michael’s other talents. His ability to command and manipulate people.

He knew Michael could fulfill his role as the heir of Renosa.

The Grand Duke could think dispassionately for Renosa’s sake That’s why, even though he found Michael unsatisfactory, he considered him as the next master of Renosa due to his other qualities.

‘A child with ambition is better than one without.’

Had Charlotte wanted it, the Grand Duke might have supported her.

But Margret cherished Michael, and Charlotte lacked ambition.

Both father and daughter were swayed by Margret.

Michael knew how to use Margret to get what he wanted.

Using his own mother might seem sly, but it wasn’t something to be criticized. He was a noble.

If the heir of Renosa had been weak, jealous, and incompetent, it would have been a greater problem.

“If you have anything more to say, I will listen.”

Michael knew when to retreat.

He had no more demands from the Grand Duke. Now, he just had to show how well he could perform the tasks given to him.

“The swordsmanship tournament is entirely your responsibility. Make sure it is handled well. You may leave.”

With the Grand Duke’s final words, Michael bowed and left the room.

His eyes were calm as he exited. The boy who had once trembled and couldn’t even speak properly in front of the Grand Duke was no longer there.

Now stood the heir of Renosa.

‘In the end, it will all fall into my hands.’

A cold smile crossed Michael’s lips.

The next day, the Greta Academy group entered the capital.

They were the fourth academy representatives to arrive in the capital.



H.F.C Chapter 221 (Part 1):
				The capital of the Principality of Renosa, Ratona. The Greta Academy group entered their smoothly assigned lodging shortly after noon.

This time, they were escorted not by the Black Wing Knights but by Renosa’s soldiers.

Nils’ impression of Ratona was this:

“It may be a small country, but its splendor is not inferior to the Empire’s marketplace.”

His words revealed that he was from the Empire.

In any case, Renosa was a wealthy nation. A small but prosperous country.

As it inherited the imperial bloodline, it maintained quite an amicable relationship with the Empire.

The current Grand Duchess was also from a noble family of the Empire.

Nevertheless, the Principality of Renosa guaranteed its independent status.

“Alright, everyone, head to your assigned rooms. Today, you can eat and rest whenever you wish.”

“Everyone has worked hard so far. It’s been a long journey, right? Rest your bodies in preparation for the upcoming tournament.”

As Instructor Alan and Instructor Patricia finished speaking, they each dispersed to unpack and rest.

No matter how skilled they were in swordsmanship, the journey in carriages all day drained their stamina.

Helmut looked around. This lodging was not exclusively allocated to Greta Academy.

Already, personnel from Loen Academy, who had arrived early, glanced over at them occasionally.

Those who arrived early had already been frequenting the training grounds to prepare for the tournament.

It’s said that Matesis Academy would soon join them here as well.

They had gathered the academy members from Baden in one place in Renosa.

Even though the hand of the temple reached here, it wasn’t as if they were planning something, but it was an odd situation.

Helmut muttered the names of the other two academies in Baden.

‘Matesis and Loen.’

Although his appearance had changed, something was still bothering him.

There was someone from Matesis Academy he recognized from when he split as Hyde.

Gordon, a sixth-year student from Matesis Academy, who had attended the martial arts tournament in Basor and fought against him.

Helmut only recently recalled his presence.

‘If he has the skills to participate in Basor’s martial arts tournament, he must have come here too.’

Helmut judged that his skills were better than those of Nils, who was also in the sixth grade.

But the difference wasn’t significant. They were almost equal.

Gordon was undoubtedly one of the top talents in Matesis Academy. It wouldn’t be wise to think he wouldn’t come.

‘He probably won’t recognize me right away though.’

Just from the face alone. Hyde and Helmut’s images were somewhat different.

However, he was an opponent Helmut had already faced once. Fortunately, Helmut was competing among the lower grades, so he wouldn’t have to face Gordon.

But what if Gordon happened to watch Helmut’s match?

Helmut’s skills were well-known even within Baden. Loen and Matesis might also take an interest.

If Gordon was perceptive, he might sense Hyde’s presence from Helmut’s movements, swordsmanship, and actions—things that couldn’t be changed by a disguise.

A measure was necessary. Helmut wasn’t very good at acting.

He first returned to his room to unpack. He had an idea of what to do.

Just then, as if on cue, he received a contact from Alea. As soon as he entered his room, he accepted her communication.

“Hello.”

Alea waved lightly from beyond the screen-like.

The view behind her was the usual dormitory room.

“So you’ve arrived in Ratona. Is that your room?”

“Yes.”

The room had become noticeably more modest. Although “modest” might not be the right term.

The room, decorated in blue tones, wasn’t as splendid as their first lodging in Renosa, but it was clean and luxurious.

This was the treatment provided equally to all academies.

Even Charlotte wouldn’t be an exception.

“It seems the other two academies from Baden are also staying here.”

“Matesis and Loen? Matesis’ swordsmanship department has a better reputation than Greta’s.”

“That reputation will change this time.”

Helmut smirked, and Alea’s laughter echoed.

“Of course. With you there. At least in the lower grade tournament, Greta will almost certainly win. But the important thing isn’t winning. There’s something more important.”

Her tone had changed. Wasn’t Alea the one who insisted on an absolute victory before?

Helmut tilted his head. There must have been a reason for her change in thought.

Alea spoke with a cautious voice.

“I’ve heard rumors that at least two High Priests are heading to Renosa. To observe the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

As you know, the temple’s permission is why Baden’s academies can participate in this tournament. They want to monitor it. They don’t like Baden.”

The temple likely suspected someone in Baden of the High Priests’ murder. Specifically, someone among the skilled members of Baden’s academies.

But even so, they wouldn’t have sent High Priests just because of the handful of selected members from Greta Academy.

Unless they were certain that the culprit was among them!



H.F.C Chapter 221 (Part 2):
				‘But I’m not the one who killed the High Priests.’

Two High Priests were killed, one in Basor and one near Baden, and Alea killed the one closer to Baden.

So Helmut wasn’t the culprit. He thought he was innocent.

The temple might simply be using this opportunity to exert more influence in Renosa while keeping an eye on Baden’s academies.

Renosa was a country under the temple’s influence.

Despite the temple’s declining power over the years, their influence, stemming from saving the world from the Demon King, still spread far and wide.

Helmut understood what Alea was trying to say.

“That means I need to be even more cautious. Even if it means giving up the win. To hide myself.”

It would have been better if he hadn’t come.

Would it have been better to give up like Asuka?

But it was an opportunity to come to Renosa. His mother was in Renosa. If he achieved good results in the swordsmanship tournament, he would naturally have a chance to approach the high-ranking officials of Renosa.

Renosa didn’t take this swordsmanship tournament lightly either.

“Yes, exactly. It could be more dangerous than you think. You… have something you’re looking for there.”

“Yes, there is something I’m looking for here.”

Did she think his attention would be distracted because of that?

Helmut was used to tension. He thought it was unnecessary worry, but he listened attentively.

“Alright, I’ll be careful.”

“About Charlotte…”

Alea hesitated whether to tell him what she found out.

Although Helmut said there was no need to find out, Alea had investigated.

And it wasn’t hard to discover. Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Wesley, a student in the swordsmanship department, already knew this. He had heard it from a high-ranking noble classmate from Renosa.

Then all she had to do was extract information from that classmate. No need for further explanation.

Alea had succeeded and discovered an astonishing fact.

‘If that’s the case, Helmut might be the heir of Renosa’s Grand Duke. At least, a blood relative of the Grand Duke.’

The current Grand Duke family of Renosa had been rather quiet compared to the previous generation.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa, except for the early days of her arrival in Renosa, did not engage much in external activities.

This might be due to the tragedies tied to their family.

But Alea had no way of delving into the distant Renosa from Baden.

She could sneak into Charlotte’s dormitory room and search it, but it wouldn’t yield much valuable information.

Charlotte had little interaction with Renosa and simply led a diligent academy life.

‘Of course, if I poured money into the information guild, I could find out anything.’

Even high-level information could be uncovered. Helmut spoke to Alea, who was hesitating.

“Forget about Charlotte. I’ll find out about Renosa myself. I have a way.”

“Are you going to get information through Black Hawk?”

“Yes.”

“That would be better.”

Alea, who had heard of Talon and Hawk Eye, agreed.

There was still a chance to gather information. This was the perfect time to use it.

‘Could they catch on to something? The possibility is low.’

In Basor, there were the Palma Knights, and in Renosa, there were the Black Wing Knights.

Since they had investigated the Palma Knights, it would be natural to investigate the Black Wing Knights as well.

Helmut was participating in the swordsmanship tournament in Renosa.

It could be perceived as proactive job seeking.

For example, looking for a future job in advance.

This would also obscure the intent behind gathering information on the Palma Knights and the high-ranking officials of Basor.

‘The Black Wing Knights and the Grand Duke family of Renosa.’

After finishing his conversation with Alea, Helmut requested exactly that from Talon.

Talon agreed to send the information to Helmut without any objections.

However, he also mentioned that it would take about a week.

With this, the opportunity to gather information was once again utilized.

The remaining chance for information had to be saved for when it was really necessary.

Of course, Talon would provide information as long as Helmut paid, so it was wise to keep the connection.

*

After a simple meal, Helmut left the lodging in the afternoon. He had remembered something he needed to do.

Today, they had permission to act freely.

Of course, they should not cause any trouble.

Renosa had good public order, so unless he picked a fight, there was hardly any trouble to be had.

Unlike the rough-natured people of Basor, Renosa’s people were relatively calm, despite their reverence for swordsmen.

They only glanced at Helmut without approaching or speaking to him.

The streets were quiet and clean, similar to the academic atmosphere of Baden.

Helmut casually strolled through the city of Ratona and headed straight to the blacksmith’s.

He had looked it up before leaving the lodging.

He was empty-handed for the first time in a while. He had his sword, but it was stored in his spatial pocket.

Renosa was not known for its swords, so few people bought swords here, but Helmut needed a Renosa sword.

He couldn’t wield Darien’s sword, which might be recognized by someone.

‘Something decent enough to use will suffice.’

There was no need to buy an expensive, high-quality sword. He just intended to buy something moderate and ordinary for disguise purposes.

Helmut was participating in a lower-grade academy tournament.

No matter how skilled a third-year was, it would be difficult for them to withstand Helmut’s single strike.

There was no need to use Vis either. He could easily handle his opponents without even getting used to a new sword.

But there was one criterion for choosing the sword.

‘A sword with a different weight or form slightly changes the swordsmanship.’

Helmut intended to buy a sword distinguishable from Darien’s sword.



H.F.C Chapter 222 (Part 1):
				Helmut frowned.

Gordon. How did he find out that he was affiliated with the Matesis Academy?

As he walked, he suddenly recalled someone’s voice.

‘Gordon? Ah, he’s a swordsman from Basor. He’s in his sixth year at Matesis Academy. He won’t be a difficult opponent for Hyde. It’ll be easy.’

Michael. He was the most peculiar noble among those Helmut had encountered. Not just Gordon, but Michael was also a problem.

‘Could he have come to Renosa?’

However, if he was an imperial citizen, Renosa wasn’t far from the Empire. It was entirely possible for him to come here.

Moreover, he had heard that some people particularly paid attention to such martial arts tournaments or swordsmanship tournaments.

Helmut had drawn too much attention at the martial arts tournament in Basor.

‘I need to be careful.’

Would there be someone as skilled as Luke Yeager or a member of the Palma Knights in this swordsmanship tournament?

It didn’t seem likely, but there was a slight sense of expectation.

Whether it was because of the swordsmanship tournament or because it was a holiday, Renosa’s streets were bustling.

Helmut pushed through the crowd and finally arrived at the blacksmith’s shop.

There were a few ready-made swords at the blacksmith’s. Helmut chose one that was heavier and longer than Darien’s sword and paid for it.

‘This should be enough.’

It was a sturdy sword. Quite high quality.

The blacksmith tilted his head as Helmut immediately selected a sword upon arriving.

“You’re not making one yourself?”

“I need a sword right away, and this one is perfect.”

“Then please wait a moment. I’ll adjust it to fit you. It will take about thirty minutes.”

The blacksmith took Helmut’s grip measurements and went to work on the sword.

Waiting in the second-floor lounge, Helmut glanced out the window. The outside seemed somewhat noisy.

A white carriage was racing down the main road. People were scattering to the sides to make way.

There were no crests on the carriage, making it impossible to tell which noble family it belonged to.

There were also nobles who traveled in carriages without crests if it wasn’t official business.

This way, they wouldn’t become targets.

However, the guards around the carriage were unusual.

Helmut narrowed his eyes. He felt a chill.

Through the carriage window, Helmut caught a glimpse of something. It was bright blond hair.

Blond hair wasn’t rare, but for some reason, it looked familiar.

‘Michael.’

Was it because he had been thinking about him a moment ago? It felt too coincidental to be a coincidence.

The carriage soon passed, and the street was once again crowded. Helmut received his sword and left the blacksmith’s shop.

If that was Michael, Helmut needed to hide his identity from those who knew about the temple, Michael, and Hyde.

It was uncertain if it was possible without an early exit from the tournament.

“Michael?”

It was a name she was hearing for the first time. Alea narrowed her eyes. Helmut briefly explained what had happened in Basor.

Because Michael was not directly involved in the central events, he had never properly talked about him.

“Do you know which noble family he’s from?”

“I know he’s from the Empire. If that’s his real name, I should be able to find out from Talon’s report.”

Now it was time to wait for Talon’s report. Alea spoke bluntly.

“If he’s very curious about you and smart, he’s dangerous. Can you just kill and get rid of him?”

“If he’s a high-ranking noble, it will be problematic.”

Helmut was not accustomed to assassination. How could he find and kill Michael unnoticed in Renosa?

“I mean, do you have the mindset to kill him if necessary?”

“I’d rather not.”

Helmut answered without hesitation. Michael had shown him kindness. Repaying kindness with death was not something Helmut desired.

Moreover, he found something about him bothersome. Not in a negative way, but it was just something that caught his attention.

‘He’s like Charlotte. But he doesn’t resemble Charlotte much.’

Nor did he resemble Helmut. It was hard to suspect any blood relation with Michael.

Although fraternal twins don’t necessarily have to look alike, Charlotte and Michael looked like they could be siblings when placed side by side.

Their personalities were also different. Charlotte was stern, while Michael was gentle and kind. They each resembled their father and mother.

Alea suggested,

“Alright then… how about changing your swordsmanship style?”

“Change my style?”

“Not the swordsmanship of the Sword Saint, but the common swordsmanship you use. But I heard there are subtle differences even in common swordsmanship. The one you use is probably similar to Basor’s style, right?”

Even common swordsmanship couldn’t be exactly the same across regions.



H.F.C Chapter 222 (Part 2):
				In Basor, people often fought monsters. Naturally, the swordsmanship also had Basor’s characteristics.

Darien, who taught Helmut, was particularly influenced by this.

“How about trying imperial common swordsmanship?”

In fact, Alea didn’t know if it was such an easy thing. She knew changing swordsmanship in just a few days wasn’t easy, but somehow Helmut seemed capable.

And it was something Helmut could do. He had reached a level where he could mimic any swordsmanship he had seen once.

Helmut suddenly recalled that there were students at the academy who used common swordsmanship.

Many students used their family’s swordsmanship, but sometimes, common swordsmanship was better than sloppy family swordsmanship.

Common swordsmanship was refined and polished for fundamentals.

‘If it’s imperial common swordsmanship… yeah, It feels more standard and balanced.’

He remembered that the stances and sword directions were subtly different. Having bought a new sword, changing his swordsmanship would make him look even less like Hyde.

Wouldn’t Greta Academy notice this change and find it strange?

‘It probably won’t be an issue.’

Helmut had finished most of his duels quickly. There hadn’t been much time for instructors to notice his Basor-style swordsmanship.

“Let’s try that then.”

Helmut nodded. It wasn’t difficult. He remembered the subtle differences between the imperial and Basor styles.

He could train with the new sword while adapting to the new style.

Alea looked at Helmut with worried eyes.

She was safe in Baden. Undeniably, Heike was behind her.

A powerful archmage who didn’t care if the temple declared her an enemy.

But Helmut was different. There was no one to protect him. He had practically walked into the enemy’s den.

Even though she had discovered his identity, Helmut was still alone.

Alea made up her mind.

‘I should head to Renosa as soon as possible.’

It would be better to handle the situation with both of them there. The fact that two high priests were heading there made her particularly uneasy.

With two high priests, Helmut, who had the Seed of Darkness, wouldn’t be able to withstand a direct confrontation if his identity was exposed.

He might not even be able to escape.

“A high priest has died, and they know about you in Basor. So, you should be more careful about hiding yourself. Even if you have to postpone the timing.”

The timing Alea referred to was, of course, the time for him to meet his mother.

Helmut had been carefully waiting for the right moment, not desperately searching. He thought it would be delayed until he gained enough power.

He hadn’t expected to get close to his mother so soon.

However, this quick approach only made him more anxious.

He reached Ratona, the capital of Renosa. It might be his birthplace, but it didn’t move him much.

What was more important were the upcoming events. He was now just one step away.

Helmut was almost there. At times like this, he needed to be extra careful.

His oversights and mistakes could turn his perseverance and efforts so far into nothing.

Helmut didn’t return to carry the burden of the temple’s enmity with his family and mother.

Helmut affirmed.

“Yes, the swordsmanship tournament is the issue for now. I’ve arrived in Renosa, so it wouldn’t be bad to drop out early.”

That might be more freeing. Achieving excellent results would make it easier to approach his mother, but now that he was in Renosa, other methods would arise.

Ways to approach Renosa’s nobles. Anyway, the selected participants of the swordsmanship tournament were treated like nobles while staying in Renosa.

It wouldn’t be difficult to get invited to a noble’s banquet.

He had heard that those who dropped out early turned to socializing to build connections.

‘If Charlotte is a high-ranking noble, I might be able to use her.’

Feigning illness to withdraw wouldn’t be a bad idea.

It wasn’t the time to think about the honor of Greta Academy or the obligations of selected participants.

Charlotte would fulfill that role faithfully.

“See you tomorrow.”

Alea waved as she finished the conversation. After she disappeared, Helmut fell into thought.

Winning was natural for him. It wasn’t easy to give up the victory.

Even Helmut wanted to return as a strong and radiant winner.

Pretending to be weak or deliberately losing was not something he was used to. Withdrawal seemed better.

Helmut leaned towards the idea of withdrawal.

Despite the expectations and hopes of the Greta Academy faculty and second-year students, it was a weight he could shake off.

He always kept a cool head.

However, in the end, Helmut did not withdraw from the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Because he faced an unexpected situation.

The next day, just three days before the tournament, the Matesis Academy team arrived, exuding confidence.

They were the favorites to win the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

They were considered the most likely to win by external evaluations, although Greta Academy did not agree.

They had always performed well in exchange duels with Greta and Loen.

‘Gordon is here too.’

Indeed, he was. Helmut observed them with indifferent eyes.

Having swung the sword a bit last night, he had gotten used to the new sword and swordsmanship. The chances of Gordon recognizing him were low.

Sure enough, Gordon did not recognize Helmut. Instead, he looked at him with a slightly dissatisfied expression and passed by.

This was not just Gordon, but the other selected members of Matesis Academy too.

‘These Greta guys look pretty lacking overall. Young ages and even a girl.’

The selected members of Greta Academy were generally young.

First-year Charlotte and second-year Helmut. Neither were big or prematurely aged.

Even the upperclassman representative Leon was only a fourth-year.

Charlotte, who looked particularly fragile, was enough to make them look down on Greta Academy.



H.F.C Chapter 223 (Part 1):
				It’s unusual for there to be no problems when the selected members from three rival academies are gathered in one place.

Especially when those members are energetic and highly skilled swordsmen.

The other academies are likely hoping for some turmoil to weaken their competition.

As for Renosa, they did not wish for the newly joined Baden Academy to win either.

Because even they cannot completely avoid the scrutiny of the temple.

Even if Baden’s academy won fairly, the temple would harbor dissatisfaction.

From the temple’s perspective, it was unthinkable for a group of non-believers from Baden to win.

Renosa wouldn’t intervene in the results, but they subtly hoped for other academies to perform well.

Regardless of their wishes, the highest level was concentrated in Baden Academy.

That’s why people went to great lengths to send their children to Baden, even from distant foreign lands.

Among them, the most famous for swordsmanship is Matesis Academy.

However, the difference in level with Greta and Loen wasn’t significant, and their reputations often fluctuated, so it couldn’t be said that they were definitively superior.

In contrast, the magic department of Greta Academy was uniquely renowned.

Lately, Greta instructors considered themselves superior to Matesis.

However, the Matesis instructors underestimated the selected members of Greta Academy.

They provoked the Greta Academy members in subtle ways.

The day after they arrived at the Ratona lodgings, a Matesis instructor requested a meeting with the faculty.

It was a meeting excluding Loen Academy.

The Matesis instructor opened his mouth with a confident attitude:

“We request a duel between four members from Greta Academy and our members.”

“A duel with our members?”

“Yes, throughout the competition period if possible. Unless they are immediate opponents, we wish to duel every day. It’s preferable for seniors to face seniors and juniors to face juniors.”

“A duel at this point, with the tournament just ahead…”

Instructor Alan expressed slight disapproval at the sudden proposal.

He thought it could lead to wasted effort.

Moreover, the tournament brackets haven’t even been announced yet. The brackets were to be drawn on the first day of the tournament.

They might end up facing Matesis right away, so was there a need for the duels?

In Baden, they might have accepted it as part of academy exchange.

“The Matesis swordsmanship department hones its skills through systematic dueling. Sometimes, we even hire mercenaries. We often hold real sword duels. We mentioned this because we’ve been busy traveling and haven’t been able to duel, so we’re concerned about losing our edge.”

The selected members of Matesis stayed at the academy until the last minute, focusing on training.

They were the most eager to win among all the academies.

“If you’re worried about injuries, we will take utmost care. We have two magic department instructors who can provide immediate treatment. Since it would be limited to four people, it’s not a bad proposal for Greta Academy either, is it?”

That was true. However, the provocative attitude of Matesis was somewhat irksome.

Yet, it didn’t seem right to reject a beneficial proposal for the students just because it was annoying.

The three faculty members exchanged glances, asking each other what they should do.

Then, the Matesis instructor added,

“Of course, we’d prefer to exclude Loen Academy. It would be best if the duels were only between Greta and Matesis, which is why we’re discussing this separately.”

“Why is that?”

“Do you really not understand?”

The Matesis instructor laughed. Naturally, they immediately understood the meaning.

It was a suggestion to exclude Loen, treating them as a common enemy.

But it seemed somewhat petty. Despite being competitors, they were all from Baden.

Excluding one out of three didn’t look good.

Loen might complain later, saying they had no honor or anything.

While Greta Academy’s magic department was formidable and pragmatic in nature,

on the flip side, their swordsmanship department had some old-fashioned tendencies.

The three faculty members, who were hesitating, finally found common ground. There was no need to cause trouble over a duel that could go either way.

Instructor Alan spoke on their behalf.

“That is an unacceptable proposal. We do not seek discord. You may extend the same offer to Loen Academy, but Greta cannot accept a duel that excludes one side in that manner.”

“Do the others share this sentiment?”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

Professor Luxen and Instructor Patricia firmly agreed.

The Matesis instructor shrugged.

“In that case, there’s nothing we can do. I thought it was a good opportunity. However, we won’t make the same offer to the Loen Academy. Rest assured.”

The Matesis instructor ended the conversation decisively. But there was a strange smile on his lips.



H.F.C Chapter 223 (Part 2):
				Shortly after the Matesis instructor bowed and left, Instructor Patricia exploded with anger.

“They won’t make the same proposal to Loen? They’re saying they don’t need to be cautious with us!”

It wasn’t to avoid offending Greta, whom they proposed to first.

If that were the case, they wouldn’t have suggested excluding Loen.

Matesis and Loen weren’t in a relationship where they were competing over Greta. In fact, the two academies had a rather good relationship.

In Baden, Matesis and Loen were close, with Greta on the opposite side.

In other words, Matesis judged that they could afford to reveal their strength to Greta, but not to Loen.

They deemed Greta an easy opponent that didn’t require caution.

This was their evaluation of Greta.

It was natural for the faculty, especially the instructors, to feel anger.

Professor Luxen responded calmly.

“Well, our selected members do appear young to them. They probably have information on Loen and thought it was worth preparing for them. But they must have judged that our members wouldn’t pose much of a challenge in a duel.”

Instructor Patricia raised her eyebrows.

“Are you going to speak so calmly about this, Professor Luxen?”

“What can we do? We’ll just have to show them in the tournament. We must not let their opinions affect our students’ pride. Friction in the dorms will only cause fatigue.”

“It might be good to hurt their pride. It could motivate them.”

Instructor Alan spoke up.

“Well, the swordsmanship students are sensitive to ranks and competition. It could be a good stimulus.”

Professor Luxen quietly agreed. His main concern remained Helmut.

*

Needless to say, Matesis Academy didn’t let it go quietly.

The Matesis instructor only explained to their selected members that Greta had refused, and thus the duel didn’t happen.

He didn’t explain the reason.

After all, as competitors, a bit of discord was better than getting along well.

The Matesis swordsmanship department adhered to the logic of power more than any other swordsmanship department.

They resented Greta’s refusal to duel, seeing it as a missed opportunity to learn.

Did Greta think they could compete equally without revealing their strength?

This almost arrogant resentment eventually found an outlet. As long as there were no physical confrontations, they could act freely.

Drawing that line, they moved relentlessly.

The most enthusiastic and diligent in practice among Greta’s selected members was Charlotte.

Even after coming to Renosa, she didn’t expect special treatment.

She wanted to showcase her skills fairly.

She hoped her efforts would pay off in the swordsmanship tournament.

But she also didn’t want to be eliminated early in a disgraceful manner.

Thus, Charlotte did everything she could and hoped for luck.

If she met a championship contender in the first round, the chances of being eliminated would be high. So all she could do was hope the draw wouldn’t turn out that way.

She had at least a minimal belief that Michael wouldn’t intentionally rig it.

The instructors didn’t hide their high expectations of her.

She received encouragement constantly. It was different from the absolute expectations on Helmut.

After all, being a first-year selected participant wasn’t something that could happen by chance alone.

Charlotte had skill, talent, and diligence. The instructors hoped she would perform well in the swordsmanship tournament.

Expectations grew.

To meet these expectations, Charlotte arrived early at the training ground.

She wasn’t given the privilege of a private training ground.

Renosa could only provide a temporary location, so they couldn’t give her that much preferential treatment.

Each academy was given a spacious shared training ground.

However, someone was already there today.

Charlotte stopped when she saw two Matesis Academy members practicing swordsmanship in the center of the training ground.

At that moment, she didn’t suspect they had any other intentions.

“Excuse me, this is the training ground allocated to Greta Academy.”

“Ah, is that so?”

Matesis members Robin and Taren greeted Charlotte calmly. She responded calmly.

“Please move to the training ground allocated to Matesis Academy.”

However, they didn’t leave willingly.

“Sorry, but this training ground is more comfortable. Our training ground over there is a bit uneven because of intense practice yesterday.”

“Since we arrived first, we’d like to use this one.”

“That’s nonsense.”

Charlotte looked at them in disbelief. She had a bad feeling.

“Understand. We’ve already warmed up, and moving is a hassle.”

“We’re in a hurry. We arrived later than expected, so we need to train quickly.”

Robin and Taren smiled and conversed nonchalantly.

Their expressions didn’t seem flustered or apologetic.

Charlotte firmly declared,

“That won’t do. Please move. Otherwise, it will escalate into an issue between academies.”



H.F.C Chapter 224 (Part 1):
				“You’re being quite fussy over nothing.”

“This much should be understandable, right? We’re already in the middle of training.”

“Yeah, since Greta’s people arrived early. We’re all from Baden’s academies, so stop being so stingy!”

Charlotte refuted their nonsensical remarks.

“We only arrived a day early. And that goes against the rules.”

“Well then, let’s talk to the instructors when they wake up.”

“Anyway, we need to finish our training.”

Robin and Taren exchanged smug smiles, looking at each other as if daring her to report them.

It seemed clear that they didn’t know who Charlotte was, or perhaps they were just late to hear the rumors.

Charlotte felt relieved, but as relieved as she was, she grew angry.

She knew their intentions. It was a common dominance dispute among swordsmanship students.

She had experienced similar things during her first semester at Greta.

Even though Charlotte was the only, and pretty girl, in the first-year swordsmanship department, there were still some who didn’t care about that.

Those individuals inevitably picked fights with her.

Of course, by the time Charlotte became the top of her first-year swordsmanship class, even the most persistent ones had given up.

Charlotte knew she shouldn’t show weakness to such opponents.

“That won’t do. Please move aside.”

Charlotte cut them off with a tone that left no room for argument.

Robin and Taren ignored her and started their training, swinging their swords.

They were using real swords. Matesis Academy emphasized real sword duels, which was why it had the highest number of injuries.

They were also selected members. Their basic moves were impressive, with their swords slicing through the air with formidable force.

Their attitude was clear: what are you going to do about it?

There were two of them and only one Charlotte. The instructors would soon wake up, and she could tell them about it.

But this kind of provocation shouldn’t be resolved that way. She was also a swordsmanship student.

Charlotte drew her sword without hesitation. It was a real sword, as they were preparing for the tournament.

Robin and Taren seemed indifferent to whatever she was about to do.

Charlotte’s sword intercepted Robin’s downward strike.

Clang!

A sharp noise rang out.

Robin frowned.

“What do you think you’re doing?”

Though not threatening, her sword thrust forward chillingly fast.

A sword imbued with Vis was hard to underestimate. For a moment, Robin stiffened.

“It means you two can’t train here. I’m going to stop you.”

It was a rare provocative attitude from Charlotte. Her gaze was intense.

Robin growled.

“Look at this? How insolent!”

“Being insolent is better than being dull-witted, I’d say. I told you this is Greta Academy’s training ground.”

Taren chuckled and nodded.

“Why don’t you just deal with her? Make her understand.”

It was clear what he meant: make her understand through skill.

Taren ranked higher than Robin, so it was Robin’s job to teach this fearless girl a lesson.

“If you want, I’ll take you on. A real sword duel.”

“Very well.”

Charlotte nodded. It was a good opportunity for her as well.

At Greta Academy, most seniors avoided dueling with her for fear of losing and being humiliated.

But these two seemed eager, confident they wouldn’t lose.

The opposite, in fact. The reason was that they didn’t think Charlotte could ever beat them.

‘At least they don’t seem to be planning to gang up on me together, thankfully.’

Matesis’ standards were high. There was no guarantee Charlotte could beat either Robin or Taren.

But unlike when facing Helmut, she didn’t feel like she would definitely lose.

Charlotte was often underestimated, but she had also achieved many unexpected victories.

Winning against complacent opponents was something she had done countless times.

And Charlotte trusted her instincts. While she wasn’t sure about Taren, she felt she could handle Robin. She could definitely win.

Robin sneered.

“Well, let’s introduce ourselves first. I’m Robin, a third-year at Matesis Academy.”

“Charlotte, a first-year at Greta Academy.”

Robin looked at her with disbelief.

“A first-year? This is a joke. Doesn’t Greta have any better talent? Or is it because you’re pretty that no one bothers to swing a sword properly at you?”

“Thank you for the compliment. Though not the kind of compliment I’d like.”

It was a familiar treatment. Everyone underestimated Charlotte. But as the Duchess of Renosa, she had never been underestimated, even by the Commander of the Black Wing Knights himself.

And Charlotte always showed them with her sword. Because that’s how swordsmen communicate.

“Doesn’t matter either way. I won’t go easy on you just because you’re a girl. You’re going to get a real lesson today.”

“We’ll see who gets taught a lesson.”

“Your mouth is sharp! But not for long.”

Robin glared at Charlotte with fierce eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 224 (Part 2):
				Taren stepped aside, sheathing his sword, ready to watch Robin humiliate Charlotte.

Charlotte and Robin positioned themselves at a proper distance, ready to begin the duel.

‘Here comes trouble.’

Robin and Taren’s eyes widened at the sight of the black-haired boy who appeared without any warning. They too failed to notice Helmut’s approach.

Helmut, as he was called, had an extraordinary aura despite his noble appearance.

His jet-black eyes were somehow hard to look straight into.

But they weren’t the type to be intimidated. They hesitated only for a moment.

“Ah, is this what you call a senior?”

Robin sneered, looking Helmut up and down.

Robin had a naturally irritating appearance, but he found Helmut’s handsome features even more annoying.

Moreover, Helmut didn’t seem particularly physically imposing regardless of the aura.

In the lower grades, physical condition and swordsmanship often determined the outcome more than Vis.

That’s why the selected members of Greta Academy were underestimated this time too.

“A referee? Sure, why not. One from Matesis, one from Greta. Just watch.”

Taren quickly concluded. Helmut leisurely walked to the side.

‘What kind of kid walks without making a sound?’

He gave off an eerie assassin-like vibe more than a swordsman. Taren glanced at him.

Helmut didn’t seem to notice Taren’s gaze. He thought Charlotte wouldn’t lose, but if she did, he would step in.

The opponent would then be Taren, but there was no need to worry about him yet. He was just a small fry.

The atmosphere calmed down, and Taren announced the start.

“One, two, three!”

The duel between Charlotte and Robin was intense.

Robin barely managed to block Charlotte’s first attack.

‘How is she so fast?’

He almost failed to counter it. It was a sword strike that could take his nose off while he watched. But it wasn’t beyond Robin’s skills to block it.

He soon realized that Charlotte’s skills were far superior to what he had imagined.

Flexible, fast, and agile. Unlike any opponent he had faced before.

‘No wonder she’s a selected member.’

He realized that the duel wouldn’t end as easily as he had thought.

A swordsman knows the strength of their opponent the moment their swords clash.

Robin wasn’t a complete fool. He discarded his complacency.

He didn’t think he would lose, but he decided to go all out.

However, even with full strength, the duel didn’t end easily. Instead, Robin felt he was on the defensive.

Charlotte had sparred numerous times with Nils, a superior version of Robin. Having gotten used to Nils, facing Robin was easier.

And with that ease, Charlotte overpowered Robin’s sword!

However, before Charlot could seize victory, the duel was inevitably cut short.

It was due to someone who appeared around the time their bodies were drenched in sweat.

“Stop right there! A real sword duel without an instructor’s supervision? What are you thinking!”

A cold command rang out. It was Instructor Alan.

Charlotte and Robin froze in place. Taren’s face stiffened.

Only Helmut remained calm. He had been thinking that Charlotte’s skills had significantly improved.

“Why are Matesis Academy’s selected members here? This is clearly Greta Academy’s training ground. Explain what happened.”

Taren adjusted his expression and smiled as he replied.

“We just came to the wrong training ground, and they immediately picked a fight. It seems Greta Academy’s swordsmanship students lack patience.”

“That’s not true! We asked them to move, but they refused!”

Charlotte glared at Taren with infuriated eyes. He shamelessly lifted his chin.

Robin, drenched in sweat, couldn’t even lift his head.

He had struggled against a mere first-year girl.

He hadn’t felt anywhere near victory. He probably would have lost.

Taren must have noticed this too.

If the senior representatives of the upper years found out, they would scold him for tarnishing Matesis’s reputation.

Robin ground his teeth.

“Charlotte doesn’t lie.”

“Well, it is true that we asked to use the training ground for a bit longer. There were two of us and one of her at the time.”

“So a fight broke out, leading to a duel. Didn’t you think to inform an instructor?”

“We thought they were still resting.”

Charlotte replied confidently. She was a model student and knew how to act accordingly.

Avoiding a provocation by reporting to an instructor was typical model student behavior, but not suitable for the top first-year swordsmanship student.

Instructor Alan looked at the two Matesis students with a cold expression.

“If you want to compete properly, do it on the stage. There will be an opportunity soon. Such induced duels are unacceptable.”

Even he couldn’t put the Matesis students on the floor and stomp on them, not with the tournament approaching.

Taron lightly apologized with a relaxed face.

“My apologies.”

“This incident will be reported to Matesis. I hope it doesn’t happen again. Next time, I won’t let it slide with just words. Understood?”

“Yes.”

Taren bowed neatly and immediately left the training ground, dragging Robin with him.

Their intention was to face the Greta selected members, not the instructors.

Thus, the situation seemed to be resolved for now.



H.F.C Chapter 225 (Part 1):
				That day, an argument broke out between the faculty of Matesis and Greta.

Though it wasn’t a physical altercation, it was an unpleasant dispute.

Matesis did issue an apology, but it was insincere.

“We apologize. However, you seem to be shielding your students like noble ladies. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing.”

That day, Instructor Alan, unusually losing his composure, told the selected Greta students not to even think about losing to Matesis.

Previously, he tried not to burden them, hoping they would showcase their skills admirably. This time, his reaction was completely different.

At that time, Helmut didn’t think too deeply about it.

Wasn’t it a dispute that could happen anywhere?

In fact, despite what Instructor Alan had said, Helmut was inclined to just drop out appropriately.

The important thing was to do it without it being obvious.

Having never been sick since birth, it was hard for him to drop out due to illness.

‘What excuse should I use to drop out?’

Given his skill, where he could defeat most opponents with a single strike, it was difficult to lose as long as he could stand on the stage, even if he had a high fever.

Helmut couldn’t find a suitable excuse, and neither could the clever Alea.

“Why don’t you just say some urgent matter came up and leave, then come back later?”

“What urgent matter?”

“Just run away and come back later, saying it was a family matter and keeping quiet?”

“Would the faculty let me off?”

Helmut had come here as a representative of the Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department.

Such behavior could lead to disciplinary action. He might even lose his eligibility as a selected member.

In that case, meeting his mother with a clear status would become impossible.

“Well, that’s true. How about this? What if someone put a laxative in your drink?”

“If that happened, I’d become famous in another way.”

There would be a fuss about finding the culprit, and Helmut would be known as the selected member who ran to the bathroom after taking a laxative at the swordsmanship tournament.

Helmut didn’t want such dishonor, and Alea agreed.

“Yeah, you’re right.”

In the end, it was up to Helmut to find a suitable way to drop out.

Although there were some glares, there were no further clashes with Matesis.

The uncomfortable coexistence of Matesis, Loen, and Greta continued.

A few days later, the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament finally began.

The opening ceremony was lively with all the academy members attending.

The Greta swordsmanship students, wearing their famously stylish uniforms, definitely stood out.

Especially the attention focused on Charlotte was overwhelming. She was the only girl among the selected members of the eight academies. Fortunately, no one seemed to recognize her.

The opening ceremony, though interspersed with grand trumpet sounds, flowed as boringly as a dean’s sermon.

The Grand Duke of Renosa did not show up. Although it was a swordsmanship tournament involving eight prestigious academies, it wasn’t as grand an event as the Basor Martial Arts Tournament.

Helmut looked around the audience and the noble seats to see if he recognized any faces, but aside from a few nobles he’d seen in Basor, there was nothing noteworthy.

The reason Helmut didn’t see Michael that day was simple. Michael had fallen ill again.

Moreover, the Grand Duke of Renosa wouldn’t have brought Michael, who wasn’t yet confirmed as the heir, to this event.

Helmut focused on another fact.

‘Has the High Priest not arrived yet?’

Whether they were delayed or had other matters, the two High Priests who were supposed to come to Renosa were nowhere to be seen.

It might be better to confirm and be vigilant today.

He couldn’t be sure if that was a good thing. It would be best if they didn’t come at all.

‘I haven’t received any contact from Talon yet either.’

Since he wouldn’t directly deliver the documents to the lodgings, he’d have to go look for Ratona’s mercenary guild.

Helmut still didn’t have information about Renosa’s high-ranking officials.

Right now, the tournament was all that lay ahead. He had familiarized himself with the new sword and swordsmanship techniques just in case.

And soon the matchup bracket was announced. Helmut and Charlotte could only face each other in the finals based on the bracket.

This tournament had no losers’ bracket. Mistakes would not be permitted.

‘But my first opponent is……’

It didn’t specify the academy, only the name.

‘Taren?’

If there was no one else with the same name, Taren was the Matesis selected member who had a conflict with Charlotte.

Though he had no grudge, he remembered. Of all the opponents, he had to face him first.

As soon as the matchups were announced, Instructors Patricia and Alan grabbed Helmut’s shoulders with serious eyes.

“You must win!”

“We’re counting on you.”



H.F.C Chapter 225 (Part 2):
				It was an intensity that even Helmut felt pressured by. If he were to lose, by any tiny chance, the consequences were worrisome.

Of course, Helmut didn’t care about their wishes. Well, it wasn’t that he didn’t care at all, but there was something more important.

His mind needed to stay calm. Because Helmut was about to take action. Petty things like pride or expectations didn’t matter……

At least, that’s what he had thought.

But the moment he stepped onto the tournament arena, those kinds of thoughts vanished completely.

Seeing Helmut on the stage, Taren sneered disdainfully.

“Hello, Baden comrade. You’ve arrived?”

The tone of “arrived” was peculiar. Taren, with his hand on his waist, looked provocatively at Helmut.

“I thought you’d use the excuse of being sick to run away.”

“”Run away?”

“I heard you telling the instructors that your body wasn’t feeling well, that your condition wasn’t good so you might not be able to perform properly. But from what I saw, you don’t seem that bad off to me.”

“…..?”

He heard that? Helmut had been emphasizing to the instructors that his condition wasn’t good, trying to lessen the pressure on him.

He had shut his mouth when he almost got checked by Professor Luxen, but.

Helmut was too strong. And too healthy. There was no way he could find an excuse to lose to this guy or skip the tournament.

‘In many ways, it’s a tough situation to avoid.’

With the careless thought that he’d find a way somehow, Helmut had uncharacteristically come up on stage.

Since the senior tournament was being held simultaneously, this side was somewhat less crowded.

Taren still had an annoying look on his face.

“It’s not too late even now. Feel free to make an excuse. Why don’t you try running away? Wouldn’t avoiding be better for keeping your dignity than losing? If you drop out from the first round, your instructors will be embarrassed.”

Helmut had grown quite indifferent to provocations. He had encountered many provocations before.

But for some reason… he couldn’t let this one slide. Should he lose to this guy even after hearing such words?

Of course, losing was the right thing to do. The High Priest hadn’t appeared yet. There were many variables. Winning the swordsmanship tournament wouldn’t bring a huge reward. The reward was rather modest.

So, for his goal, it would be better to endure and back down.

However.

“After this match is over.”

“After it’s over?”

“I have a question to ask you. Will you answer?”

Helmut abandoned formalities. Taren was a third-year. He was older, but there was no need to respect someone who provoked him. He wasn’t Charlotte.

“Well, sure. I’m curious about the question.”

Taren made a sly expression. He still seemed confident.

The Greta selected members were considered inferior to the Matesis selected members. Matesis was the favorite to win.

Everyone thought so, except for the people from Greta Academy. Even Loen Academy only kept an eye on Matesis, not caring much about Greta.

Just as everyone thought, Taren thought so too. Moreover, hadn’t Greta refused this side’s duel proposal?

If Matesis was going to win anyway, they could have helped as a fellow academy from Baden.

For that trivial reason, the belligerent Matesis selected members held a grudge and provoked them.

It was okay to do that to Charlotte. Charlotte wasn’t that strong. But doing the same to Helmut was a different matter.

Soon, the announcement echoed.

“Matesis Academy’s representative Taren! Greta Academy’s representative Helmut! Start immediately when the signal sounds!”

Taren, who had been relaxed, suddenly focused and put his hand on his waist.

No matter how easy the opponent seemed, he had been trained not to be careless.

In contrast, Helmut was composed. He calmly placed his hand on the sword hilt.

Not Darian’s sword, but a newly purchased one. A good sword, but incomparable in quality.

But didn’t they say a carpenter doesn’t blame his tools? His sword was sharp enough to cut through a person’s neck.

‘I probably shouldn’t kill though.’

Helmut leisurely gripped the sword hilt. The comprehensive swordsmanship tournament was fought with real swords.

But according to the rules, killing was forbidden. Excessive cruelty and dismembering or torturing the opponent were also prohibited.

In unavoidable cases, casualties could happen, but that was literally unavoidable.

There was no need to use the sword either. Helmut knew a better way.

-Booooong!

Soon, the signal rang out. Helmut immediately sprang into action. His sword remained in its sheath.

Taren drew his sword. But that was the last thing he remembered.

Pak! The massive impact knocked him out instantly. The spinning vision found its place at some point.

‘What, what is this? What….’

The sky was upside down. When he regained consciousness, Taren realized he was lying on the stage, looking at the sky.

Excruciating pain shot through him. Helmut’s first sword strike was slamming the sword hilt into his head.

Helmut struck Taren’s falling body five times with the sword hilt. The pain was guaranteed.

Taren grimaced and groaned in agony. Indescribable pain spread throughout his body.

Helmut lightly pointed his sword at Taren’s neck. A calm question followed.

“What did you say earlier?”

Taren couldn’t answer. His pride was shattered, and he was in no condition to respond.

Soon, the familiar announcement echoed.

“Helmut wins!”

Helmut left the stage, leaving the fallen Taren behind.

A feeling of unease lingered. The plan had gone awry. It wasn’t that elaborate of a plan, but still.

‘Winning one round should be fine.’

There were still more matches. Even if he lost the next match, it wouldn’t be a big problem.

Helmut tried to justify himself.

His dropout plan had failed so far. And it was uncertain if it would succeed in the future.



H.F.C Chapter 226 (Part 1):
				Now, there were two people avoiding Helmut at the dormitory: Leon and Taren.

Taren said he eventually couldn’t get up on stage that day and was carried out.

Although no one saw it properly, it was known that Helmut won without drawing his sword.

The memorable scene of him beating his opponent with just the scabbard, fortunately, didn’t spread much due to the lack of witnesses.

However, it was gradually becoming known, especially about the tremendous gap in skill he displayed.

As soon as Helmut returned to the dormitory that day, he received a lot of attention.

Especially the gazes from the Matesis guys felt piercing.

It turned out that Taren was considered a top contender among the lower-year representatives. Although Robin was also skilled, he wasn’t on Taren’s level.

In other words, from that day on, Helmut became the strongest contender in the dormitory.

“You showed that Matesis guy what you’re made of, didn’t you?”

That afternoon, Nils passed by patting Helmut’s shoulder as he said that. Charlotte also hardened her expression and said,

“Senior, I don’t think it’s right to expose your true abilities in the early stages of the tournament. But you were still amazing.”

It was the first time Helmut saw such an admiring look in Charlotte’s eyes. She was determined like a model student.

‘As a fellow Greta student, I should strive to compete with Senior Helmut.’

Charlotte’s tournament was the next day.

Of course, Charlotte would only meet Helmut in the finals, and unless she competed in her best condition, her chances of reaching the finals were slim.

Charlotte was a first-year, and this tournament included up to third-year students.

No matter what resolution Charlotte held, it was irrelevant to Helmut.

Helmut only thought he must get eliminated next time.

‘Next time…’

He felt that more proactive measures would be needed to ensure his elimination, rather than half-hearted attempts.

That day, trouble inevitably came from Matesis. It wasn’t a formal complaint, just trouble.

A Matesis instructor, who Helmut encountered while passing by, couldn’t hide his anger and threw a criticism at Instructor Patricia.

“Your student is nothing but a hooligan. I’m questioning the education at Greta Academy. How can he pull such a stunt in a legitimate duel? Who is this Helmut anyway?”

Everyone who watched knew that Helmut had intentionally beaten his opponent. That was the point being criticized.

Instructor Patricia scoffed and retorted.

“What can we do if our student’s skill is overwhelmingly superior to yours? Winning without even drawing the sword in a duel. You should strive harder!”

The Matesis instructor couldn’t respond and stormed off.

Feeling triumphant, Instructor Patricia came to the training ground and silently patted Helmut’s shoulder.

Helmut looked at her puzzled.

“Instructor?”

Instructor Patricia suddenly frowned and, placing her hand on his shoulder, asked worriedly.

“Was your condition bad? I didn’t expect you to hit your opponent with the scabbard.”

“Maybe.”

Did the instructor think he shouldn’t have done that? There was a certain dignity expected of Greta Academy students.

Helmut thought it was better to say he was feeling unwell.

However, Instructor Patricia didn’t criticize him at all.

“Anyway, well done. You did great. If that’s how well you perform when you’re unwell, there’s nothing to worry about. The championship is yours, Helmut!”

She smiled with satisfaction. After advising him not to overdo it and to recover his condition, she left.

After she left, Helmut felt a heavy weight on his mind. Any excuse wouldn’t work anymore.

Unless he feigned a high fever, Helmut didn’t know how to naturally get eliminated.

That night, Alea nodded when she heard the news that Helmut couldn’t get eliminated.

“I expected as much.”

Helmut didn’t have a talent for this sort of thing.

In other words, he was bad at pretending to be sick or such.

It seemed Alea had also been thinking about it because she soon spoke again.

“I have a good idea. The day after tomorrow is your next match, right? Leave the dormitory that morning.”

“Leave?”

“Yes, head towards Baden. We stay in contact through our bracelets, right? Say you got a signal and thought I was in danger. But it turned out to be a misunderstanding. I made a mistake.

You only realize this while heading towards Baden and return by evening. If I contact the faculty, it will seem more natural.”

“Isn’t it a stretch for me to rush out thinking you were in danger when you’re at the academy?”

There was still the issue of the final exams. Alea seemed relaxed, but she was studying until dawn.

Still, she had enough time to contact Helmut in between studying.

In fact, studying was just a habit for Alea – she had already finished preparing for the exams.

“Just say you couldn’t think that far. It seemed urgent, so you ran out with your sword.”

Helmut raised an eyebrow.

“That’s a bit forced.”

Giving her every benefit of the doubt, even if his girlfriend was in danger, would he really ignore the swordsmanship tournament, not even leave word with the instructors, and just rush out with only his sword?

However, he cannot simply disappear like that just because a friend might be in danger, without knowing the full situation.

That would cause unnecessary misunderstandings, like Helmut and Alea having some secret relationship.

No matter how close friends they are, that would be going a bit too far.



H.F.C Chapter 226 (Part 2):
				It was an issue arising from the fact that only the dean knew Alea was disguised as a man.

Helmut pointed out one fact.

“Professor Luxen can track me.”

A magic department professor could do that. He had been keeping a close eye on Helmut lately.

He even volunteered to watch the lower-year swordsmanship tournament.

If Helmut disappeared, he would be the first to know.

He might even be monitoring him now, sensing Helmut wanted to get eliminated from the tournament.

“Then, do you have a plan?”

Alea asked with a sigh. Helmut gave a predictable answer.

“I’ll figure something out.”

He had to make a decision on his own now.

*

The next day was Charlotte’s tournament.

It was uncertain whether she would advance to the next stage.

Her opponent was said to be a second-year from the Imperial Academy. Being selected as a representative meant he was likely the top student of his year.

‘They will all be tough opponents for me.’

Charlotte, who had diligently trained in the familiar air of Ratona, felt confident.

‘Alright.’

She wasn’t sure if her mother would be watching, but she intended to do her best. Her eyes gleamed with determination.

Charlotte tied her long hair tightly. It was almost time for her match.

Meanwhile, Michael was ill. Of course, he was often sick, so it wasn’t unusual.

Michael no longer cursed his frail body as he used to.

But it was still frustrating when his body didn’t cooperate.

‘I’ve prepared for this tournament and now I can’t watch it.’

A bitter smile appeared on Michael’s lips, who had been bedridden for days.

His condition had improved, but moving around was still too much. It seemed he was being punished for treating Charlotte poorly.

Whenever he had conflicts with Charlotte, Michael would always fall ill.

As twins, Michael and Charlotte were connected in some way, causing such effects.

Yet, Michael couldn’t help but bother Charlotte.

‘Today is the day Charlotte competes.’

Michael furrowed his brow. Pushing himself to get up would worsen his condition.

But Charlotte might get eliminated today.

She was still a first-year, too young to achieve notable results in the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Even though she had been trained by the commander of the Black Wing Knights and was a talented student at Greta Academy.

All participants in this tournament were so-called geniuses.

So this might be the first and last chance for him to see her compete in the tournament he organized.

‘Do I want Charlotte to get eliminated?’

In the past, he would have been consumed by jealousy, hoping for her elimination.

But now, it wasn’t quite the same. Time apart seemed to have had a healing effect. Michael pondered.

“Michael, are you feeling any better?”

A worried voice came. The only person who could enter his room without permission.

Michael looked up. An elegant blonde noblewoman was looking down at him.

“Mother.”

“I heard your fever has gone down… but you still can’t get up. This bout of flu has been quite severe.”

Michael closed his eyes and smiled gently.

“Please keep your distance. I wouldn’t want you catching my flu.”

“I rarely get the flu, you know.”

“Indeed.”

Surprisingly, Michael was the only weak one in the Renosa family.

Even his mother, who didn’t wield a sword, was very healthy.

That was why Michael had felt extreme deprivation. The whole family was healthy and strong, but he was frail alone.

“What a shame. You love swordsmanship tournaments. You must be disappointed not to watch it.”

He had the privilege of watching the matches from the best seat as the host.

But it was meaningless if his body couldn’t keep up.

“Yes, it’s a shame.”

Michael suddenly had a good idea.

“Today is Charlotte’s match. Could you watch it on my behalf?”

“Are you sure that’s alright?”

In fact, the Grand Duchess of Renosa knew Michael was jealous of Charlotte.

She looked at him with surprised eyes.

“Yes, of course. Charlotte will be happy to see you.”

“I’m glad you’re thinking of Charlotte. She will appreciate it.”

If Charlotte knew Michael sent her, she wouldn’t be so pleased. She would be suspicious of his intentions.

But she would be happy to see their mother watching her.

‘Although she probably wouldn’t want to be eliminated in front of Mother… I wonder how it will turn out.’

While harboring mischievous thoughts, Michael still spoke with an angelic expression.

“That’s fortunate. Just watch from a distance. Charlotte doesn’t want her identity revealed.”

“Of course. I’ll be careful.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa gave Michael warm tea and medicine before leaving gracefully.

She was heading straight to the tournament hall.



H.F.C Chapter 227 (Part 1):
				The Grand Duchess of Renosa was an impeccable noblewoman.

With her blonde hair and blue eyes, she was a beauty with an air of grace and sophistication, hailing from one of the most prestigious noble families in the empire.

A fitting partner for the Grand Duke of Renosa, who carried the royal bloodline.

Although she did not enjoy public engagements, the Grand Duchess supported the Grand Duke quietly from behind the scenes.

Even the cold-hearted Grand Duke of Renosa cherished her deeply.

The fact that the Grand Duchess favored Michael wasn’t an issue. She never openly supported Michael in the succession competition, maintaining a certain level of neutrality.

It was only natural for a mother to be particularly concerned about her frail young son, who seemed to be at death’s door.

Some merely found this bias unfortunate.

*

Before the tournament began, Charlotte frowned upon meeting someone.

“It’s troublesome if you visit me like this.”

She had been called to a nearby room after entering the waiting room.

There, Charlotte encountered a familiar face.

Alonso, the commander of the Black Wing Knights.

His piercing eyes shone beneath his hood. Dressed not in armor or the Knights’ uniform, but in noble attire with his hood pulled low, he radiated an aura that couldn’t be underestimated.

No one could instinctively look down on him. His presence alone confirmed his identity as the commander of the Black Wing Knights.

He smiled at the young grand duchess.

“I’m on vacation. I didn’t come to see Lady Charlotte. I came to see my disciple, Charlotte.”

Despite this, he showed due respect.
