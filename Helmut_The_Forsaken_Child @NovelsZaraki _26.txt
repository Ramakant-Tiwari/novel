“I was careful not to be detected. Don’t worry. But it seems you’re not pleased to see me.”

Only then did Charlotte’s face brighten.

“I’m glad you came.”

“Do you have confidence in winning?”

“I want to win.”

“You seem confident. Your eyes are sharp.”

“I don’t know how far I’ll go, but I’ve been lucky so far. I believe I can at least advance to the next stage.”

Charlotte awkwardly smiled. She wasn’t used to openly speaking about underestimating her opponents.

Alonso responded leisurely.

“It’s fine. As long as you’re not complacent. By the way, I heard His Highness Michael visited you… How was it?”

Alonso scrutinized Charlotte’s face.

“We exchanged greetings well.”

Charlotte succinctly ended the conversation.

Even though Alonso was her master and a retainer of the grand ducal house, it wasn’t wise to expose family matters. In this regard, Charlotte was every bit the great noblewoman.

Charlotte’s gaze was firm, unwavering. Alonso spoke after a moment.

“…I was going to mention it, but I suppose it’s better this way.”

“What is it?”

“The Grand Duchess has come to the arena. Probably to watch her daughter’s match.”

“My mother?”

Charlotte’s eyes widened.

She had assumed Michael was unwell and wouldn’t appear at the tournament.

When Michael was sick, the Grand Duchess’s attention was entirely on him.

She didn’t expect her mother to be interested in her match, believing she wouldn’t even look at her matches on the bracket.

“She doesn’t usually enjoy these kinds of tournaments, so she must have come to see your match. Do you feel motivated?”

“Yes.”

Alonso looked at Charlotte with a pitying gaze as her face lit up.

After a few more words, Alonso was the first to bid farewell.

“Then I’ll be off. I wish you the best of luck.”

“Thank you for coming, Master.”

As soon as he left, Charlotte sighed as she returned to the waiting room.

She wondered what Michael would do if he found out about this.

‘It should be fine. He must have acted discreetly.’

Even Michael couldn’t track every move of the Black Wing Knight commander, especially since he was currently bedridden.

Charlotte found solace in knowing that someone in Ratona prioritized her over Michael.

The problem was that person happened to be the Black Wing Knight commander. The fact that he was on her side was significant.

But no one could harm or pressure Alonso.

In Renosa, if not as much as the commander of the Palma Knights in Basor, the Black Wing Knight commander held a formidable presence.

Even Michael wouldn’t dare lay a hand on him.

‘For now, I need to focus on today’s tournament.’

Though confident, her opponent was no pushover. She couldn’t afford to be distracted.

Charlotte steeled herself.



H.F.C Chapter 227 (Part 2):
				Waaaah—!

Amidst the thunderous cheers, two selected participants stepped onto the stage.

One was a slender girl with black hair.

Her face bore some resemblance to the Grand Duke, but few in the arena had seen the Grand Duke of Renosa, so her identity wasn’t questioned.

‘There seem to be more people here than during my match.’

Helmut glanced around.

He had thought he could leisurely watch the tournament, but that seemed unlikely.

Unlike yesterday, the stands were quite full.

Many who failed to get tickets for the senior matches had obtained tickets for the junior matches, but today’s matchups were particularly interesting.

Charlotte. She was the only female among the selected participants.

Her presence had garnered much attention since before the tournament began.

Helmut wasn’t particularly interested in Charlotte’s match.

It would be preferable if she didn’t get eliminated, but even if she did, it wouldn’t matter much to him.

Helmut’s reason for being here wasn’t to scout his competitors.

It was a sudden impulse to watch a swordsmanship tournament from the audience’s perspective. He had always been a participant, never having sat in the stands.

He also wanted to see who watched these matches, especially the high-ranking individuals in the best seats.

Fortunately, most of the spectators didn’t recognize him, and those who did merely glanced his way without approaching, allowing him some peace.

Not having any special privileges as a selected participant, Helmut had to purchase a ticket at full price.

Nevertheless, he succeeded in securing a decent spot to watch the tournament.

‘I only need to watch Charlotte’s match.’

For a while, he wouldn’t have to think about how to get eliminated.

Helmut still hadn’t found an answer to that problem.

Though some might recognize Charlotte, many high-ranking nobles filled the best seats.

Helmut focused his gaze on the highest, shaded seats.

He sensed a concentration of skilled knights there.

Helmut narrowed his eyes.

‘Is there a high-ranking noble up there? I can’t see.’

Even with good eyesight, it’s hard to see from below unless the angle is right. Not unless the person reveals themselves.

They seemed to be hiding due to potential assassination attempts, making it hard to identify them.

‘No rush.’

He wasn’t expecting much anyway. Helmut decided to watch the match calmly.

Soon, the match began.

-Booooong!

Charlotte had certainly improved her skills. Helmut could feel it.

Though he usually paid no attention to others’ skills, Charlotte was different.

She was diligent, treated him as a senior, was presumed to be related by blood, and they had exchanged quite a few words. They were relatively close.

He had enough interest to compare her current achievements to the past. Helmut realized anew.

‘Even if we’re not related by blood, I might hesitate to kill her if she became an enemy.’

Charlotte was one of the few who gave him such a feeling.

Helmut watched Charlotte’s match closely.

This time, her opponent was challenging. Not a large, clumsy one, but a small, agile one.

The opponent was stronger than Charlotte. But Helmut didn’t feel like she would lose.

Though it wouldn’t be easy, she would win if she didn’t lose focus. But since they were using real swords, there was a risk of injury.

And then it happened.

Charlotte deliberately created an opening, and her opponent’s sword rushed in.

Blood trickled down Charlotte’s cheek. But in exchange for that small wound, she thrust her sword under her opponent’s neck.

“Charlotte, wins!”

The arena echoed with thunderous cheers. Charlotte calmly wiped the flowing blood.

The wound would heal without a trace after receiving healing magic.

In the midst of the deafening noise, Helmut sensed a commotion above and looked up.

And he saw her. A blonde woman leaning over the edge with a shocked expression.

Even from a distance, her figure stood out clearly against the railing.

‘That woman is….’

It was like a lightning bolt. His heart momentarily froze and then beat rapidly.

Something growled inside him, like a solid rock beginning to roll.

Helmut instantly recognized her. It was instinctual.

A distant memory etched in his mind surged up.

‘Helmut!’

The cry resonated vividly in his ears. Helmut stood up abruptly.

But his legs wouldn’t move. He just stood there.

Despite the shock, he knew he couldn’t go to her.

Helmut just stared at the blonde woman.

A complaint soon came from behind.

“Hey, what are you doing standing there? Sit down, I can’t see.”

“Who is that woman?”

Helmut asked.

The man who had spoken was about to get angry, but he calmed down upon receiving Helmut’s fierce gaze.

‘This kid, his eyes look like he just killed several people!’

“Which woman?”

“The one standing at the top, by the railing. Is she a noble?”

Squinting, the man looked in the direction Helmut indicated and spoke.

“If you mean that woman, she seems to be the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Probably. I heard the nobles gossiping about her being here. She must be startled by the girl bleeding. They say she’s a beauty, and indeed, she is!”

“The Grand Duchess…of Renosa?”

Helmut repeated the title the man spoke.

He had never felt his mind go blank like this. He couldn’t remember what to do.

Helmut recognized her. His mother. The reason he wanted to leave the Forest of Roots.

But then what?

The blonde woman soon turned back towards the shaded area, led by others.

Because Charlotte had left the stage to receive treatment.

As she kept looking back at the stage, her gaze suddenly shifted. As if sensing someone watching her.

She looked toward where Helmut was standing in the audience.

She seemed to freeze, having discovered something.

Clear blue eyes and dark eyes met in a straight line.

For a moment, it felt like their eyes met.



H.F.C Chapter 228 (Part 1):
				However, she turned away. Her movement was so smooth that it felt like the brief pause had been an illusion.

Surrounded by knights, the lady disappeared into the shade without hesitation.

It felt as though something had been dug out from inside him. A sense of regret stabbed at his heart.

‘There’s no way she saw me…right?’

She had merely glanced down at the spectators.

Many people here had been looking at her. Could she really have seen him clearly from this distance with normal eyesight?

Helmut was merely a boy with black hair who resembled her forsaken son, a boy she might have completely forgotten by now.

A joke was thrown from behind.

“Fell for her, didn’t you? She’s quite a beauty. But no matter how beautiful, a kid like you shouldn’t be coveting a married woman… Hik!”

The man who made the joke gasped as he met Helmut’s pitch-black pupils and leaned back, startled.

Helmut did not punish him. There was no point in staying here any longer.

He moved his gaze, took one last look at the shaded area, and then left the place.

“What was that…?”

The Duchess of Renosa mumbled as she looked back at the railing. Her mind was restless.

What she saw…

A worried expression appeared on the lady’s face. The maid sitting next to her offered words of comfort.

“You must be worried. It seems Her Highness bled a bit… but they say it’s a minor accident for a swordsmanship tournament. She’ll be fine after receiving treatment.”

“Ah, yes, you’re right.”

Lost in thought, she snapped back to her senses. Charlotte.

The Duchess of Renosa had come to see her daughter at this swordsmanship tournament.

While watching the match, Charlotte had suddenly bled… Although she seemed to have won, the surprised Duchess had rushed to the railing to look down.

And then, she felt a piercing gaze.

She had instinctively turned towards the gaze.

Though she was accustomed to being stared at, this kind of look was unfamiliar.

The other person seemed to be a boy, about Charlotte’s age.

Black hair, black eyes. The boy with familiar colors looked somehow familiar to her.

A sharp, fleeting pain shot through her like a flash.

But above all, his gaze…

‘He looks like him…’

The Duchess of Renosa, Margret, was startled by her own thoughts.

A distant memory, buried deep within the lake of her memories, surfaced. It was a memory buried very deep.

It was easy to forget since it wasn’t really a memory, but she hadn’t forgotten.

Because, to parents, children are like that.

Margret closed her eyes slowly and then opened them. Her breath, which had quickened momentarily, returned to normal.

‘There’s no way… He’s dead.’

The maid draped a shawl over her shoulders and suggested.

“You should go see Her Highness Charlotte. She’ll be waiting in the room prepared separately.”

“Ah, yes. I should… go see her.”

Margret calmed her mind again. Her worry for Charlotte resurfaced.

“Let’s go quickly.”

“Yes, Your Grace.”

*

The door opened, and a beautiful lady stepped inside.

Seeing her, Charlotte hurriedly stood up from her seat.

“Mother.”

“Yes, Charlotte. Are you alright?”

“I’ve been treated, so I’m fine now.”

Although the wound on her cheek had already healed, Margret stroked the spot tenderly.

Charlotte was perfectly fine. She was a bit tired, but she felt good.

Her mother had come to see her, and she had secured her advancement to the second round.

But Margret’s expression did not soften.

“I knew swordsmanship tournaments were rough, but watching it in person is truly nerve-wracking. You could have died.”

“I won’t die. The stage is prepared for accidents.”

Charlotte smiled calmly.

Even so, one couldn’t immediately block a descending sword, but as long as she was breathing, she could be saved.

If one thought about such dangers and got scared, they couldn’t be a swordsman. Charlotte was a swordsman.

“It’s impressive that you swing your sword without blinking in such a place. I couldn’t even see how you moved properly.”

Her mother seemed to see Charlotte in a new light.

To her, Charlotte had just been a young daughter who knew how to handle a sword a bit.

“I’ve been handling swords since I was young. It’s familiar to me.”

“Still, be careful. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have taught you the sword…”

Margret spoke wishfully. As a member of the Renosa duchy, Charlotte had to learn the sword.

Even Michael had learned a bit of swordsmanship. Though he had to stop because he fell ill.

“I like swords. You don’t need to worry. I’m careful enough not to get hurt.”

“You should be. I’m proud of you for showing such excellent performance as a representative of the academy, even though you’re only a first-year.”

“Thank you.”

Margret patted Charlotte’s shoulder. Charlotte felt good being recognized.

Even if her mother being here was Michael’s doing, it was still something.

She was still young and craved her mother’s attention.



H.F.C Chapter 228 (Part 2):
				“How was the tournament venue? Was it comfortable to watch?”

“Yes, it was. It was in full view. Normally, Michael would have attended, but he’s ill… He told me about your match. He’s been thinking a lot about you lately.”

Margret spoke softly, as if encouraging reconciliation.

“I hope Michael gets well soon. Unfortunately, I can’t visit him.”

Charlotte responded calmly. It wasn’t just because she was participating in the tournament.

Michael disliked it very much when Charlotte visited him while he was ill. He probably felt inferior.

Charlotte quickly changed the subject.

“Has anything special happened? Did you see anything unusual? It’s been a while since you came to watch a swordsmanship tournament, hasn’t it?”

“Yes, it has. Something unusual…”

Margret’s eyes narrowed. She spoke, shaking off her heavy heart.

“I saw a boy with black hair in the audience. I couldn’t see his face well, but he seemed to be about your age. He had black hair and black eyes like the Duke. Really, as dark as the abyss.”

Margret thought the boy also resembled Charlotte. Charlotte tilted her head.

“Could it be senior Helmut? He might have come to watch since he doesn’t have a match today.”

“Helmut… you say?”

Margret’s hand twitched. Charlotte didn’t notice her reaction.

“Do you remember? I think I mentioned it during the vacation. He’s a senior, a year above me, and a commoner with exceptional skills… Though he’s said to be a commoner, I suspect he might be a distant relative of our family. He might have inherited the blood of Renosa in some distant way.”

“Why do you think so?”

“I heard some people say he resembles me.”

To say that the daughter of the Duchess of Renosa resembled a mere commoner would be enough to warrant execution outside the academy.

But the academy students didn’t know Charlotte’s true identity. They spoke without hesitation.

They, too, were mostly nobles, so they felt no restraint.

“Really? They say you resemble a commoner.”

Margret frowned. She had lived her entire life as a high-ranking noble.

Even if she didn’t despise commoners, she had never considered herself equal to them.

“Still, I think we look quite alike. They say we look like siblings when we stand side by side.”

Charlotte felt a vague sense of closeness to Helmut. Despite his cold and somewhat eerie impression.

Charlotte thought it was probably because she and Helmut looked alike.

“Do you really resemble each other that much…”

Margret trailed off. Charlotte resembled her father. That meant she resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa.

That boy named Helmut must also resemble the Grand Duke of Renosa.

Charlotte spoke without much thought, but it was a situation that could raise suspicions of illegitimacy.

But Margret didn’t consider such doubts. She gently pressed her temples.

Her insides felt hot. Margret couldn’t resist the turmoil rising within her heart.

‘It doesn’t make sense.’

It was an impossible situation. But what was this feeling? Sometimes, there are things that cannot be explained by words.

It was an inexplicable force that couldn’t be ignored as if nothing had happened.

Noticing Margret’s distress, Charlotte quickly added.

“Don’t think too much about it. It’s just my guess. I’ve heard that senior isn’t from Renosa or the empire.”

The Grand Duke of Renosa hadn’t left the empire or Renosa in the past 15 years.

Moreover, if it were the Grand Duke, he would have treated his illegitimate child decently or taken care of him completely.

He wouldn’t have left his illegitimate child to grow up secretly as a commoner.

“Is that Helmut boy really that skilled? For you to be so interested.”

“Yes, I can assure you it would be strange if senior Helmut didn’t win this tournament. He’s a senior I can learn a lot from as a fellow swordsman.”

“I see… interesting.”

Margret responded with a squint. Her confusion was gradually clearing up.

She just hadn’t known what to do. Now she knew what to do.

‘I need to meet him.’

Margret decided. Charlotte, thinking her mother was starting to take an interest in Helmut, quickly continued.

“Senior has advanced to the second round, so he has a match tomorrow. Though it will be over quickly. Senior Helmut doesn’t like to drag things out.”

Even if he didn’t join the Black Wing Knights, it wouldn’t hurt to impress the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Charlotte thought positively.

“Hmm. I understand.”

Margret replied, speaking slowly after a moment.

“I’ll have to watch him.”

“Won’t the Grand Duke be attending?”

The Grand Duke was interested in swordsmanship tournaments, unlike Margret. He was a swordsman himself.

“The Grand Duke has left Ratona for some business. He won’t be back for a while.”

“I see.”

Charlotte didn’t ask further.

The only one who could ask beyond that was the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Here was simply Charlotte, Greta Academy’s representative.

“Then you should go rest.”

“I’ll see you from a distance tomorrow.”

“Come back to the palace as soon as the tournament is over.”

“Yes, mother.”

The conversation ended with smiles. But the confusion from the new information was just beginning.

Watching Charlotte leave the room with a bright face, Margret placed a hand on her chest.

Her heart was pounding. She hoped to find out the reason for this throbbing.

The dead cannot return.

But Margret needed to confirm it.

‘Confirm it and…’

What would happen next was still unknown.



H.F.C Chapter 229 (Part 1):
				Helmut returned to the lodge and swung his sword. He was so focused that he hardly heard anyone trying to talk to him.

Swinging his sword like this allowed Helmut to forget many things.

Problems he didn’t know how to solve.

His sword was clear and produced the desired result.

But life wasn’t like that. Choices weren’t either.

So far, Helmut had made pretty good choices. Could he continue to do so in the future?

Helmut felt himself weakening in the face of what he desired most. Confusion.

It was a human trait he didn’t know he possessed.

‘Grand Duchess of Renosa.’

Helmut saw the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

And he was certain. She was the woman from his long-ago memories.

Mother. Despite the long years, her appearance hadn’t changed much. Could his memory be mistaken?

Could he be deluding himself due to his longing to find his mother?

Helmut was sure, but he needed more certainty.

He had to meet her.

But continuing the expedition like this was dangerous.

Even the bold Alea, who said one must take risks when necessary, had warned him several times.

Helmut looked down at the sword he had just become familiar with.

Countless thoughts crossed his mind, but they soon converged into one.

Nothing could be decided before tomorrow.

Helmut would face that tomorrow.

*

On the second day, after the first round, the competitive structure of the three academies in Baden became clear.

All selected members of Greta Academy advanced to the second round.

Two selected members of Loen Academy were eliminated, and two advanced.

One selected member of Matesis Academy was eliminated, and three advanced.

Contrary to expectations, Greta Academy, which was looked down upon the most, achieved the best results, causing the instructors of the other academies to look displeased.

But skill is undeniable.

Helmut’s skill, especially in brutally defeating Taren, the winning candidate from Matesis Academy, was undeniable.

Students or not, instructors had to have at least that much sense of reality.

The atmosphere at the lodge changed slightly. Originally distant from Greta Academy, Loen and Matesis seemed to be banding together to exclude Greta.

It seemed they had developed a grudge against Greta Academy for no particular reason.

Instructors Patricia and Alan exchanged a few words.

“What’s this atmosphere? They’re only whispering among themselves, and it’s not pleasant.”

“Don’t worry about it. After all, Matesis and Loen are close to each other and have frequent exchanges even in Baden.”

“Looks like Matesis will only duel with Loen from now on?”

“Doesn’t matter. Anyway, the championship will be ours, Greta’s.”

“Ah yes, indeed.”

Instructor Patricia smiled brightly. The atmosphere among the faculty was most relaxed at Greta Academy.

Perhaps the experience of dueling with the unique Charlotte had helped, as the sixth-year Nils also showed noticeable improvement.

Leon, who had seemed listless after losing to Helmut, was back on track.

After facing opponents in the first round, they seemed insignificant compared to Helmut. Helmut was exceptionally outstanding.

Leon was still strong and a championship candidate. However, despite regaining his confidence, he still avoided Helmut.

It was due to an inexplicable fear that remained.

And another one, Taren from Matesis Academy, had a reason to avoid Helmut.

Those who were eliminated had the freedom to pack up and leave or stay. Some, having come to Renosa, intended to visit the beautiful city of Ratona.

But Taren, who was eliminated because of Helmut, quickly packed his things and left the quarters.

Of course, this was permitted by the instructors. The absence of one person wasn’t noticeable.

Everyone was focused on training to achieve good results in the tournament.

On the first day of the second round, before leaving the quarters, Helmut was held by the instructors and received a few words of encouragement. Mostly, it was along the lines of trusting him.

No one tried to give Helmut advice. The instructors knew he was someone who didn’t need advice.

Just as he was about to leave, Charlotte appeared and quickly spoke to him.

“Senior, you came to the arena yesterday, right?”

“Yes, I watched your match.”

Helmut gave Charlotte his attention. He had a guess why the Grand Duchess of Renosa was there.

It wasn’t out of curiosity about the female participants but to watch Charlotte’s match.

For her to cling to the railing after seeing the bleeding from Charlotte’s cheek, they must be very close.

In other words, as he guessed, Charlotte was his younger sister.

She seemed closer to that than being his brother’s fiancée. Helmut and Charlotte looked alike.

“I knew it. Someone said they saw you.”

Charlotte hesitated for some reason. She had tried to talk to Helmut yesterday too.

But she withdrew when she noticed his intense demeanor, likely due to the tournament occupying his mind. It wasn’t an urgent matter anyway.

Helmut asked subtly. For some reason, his question felt heavy as it left his lips.

“Someone saw me?”

“Someone close to me. They might come to watch the tournament today too. If there’s a chance, I’d like to introduce you later.”

Charlotte hadn’t forgotten that Helmut mentioned Margret’s maiden name.

But she didn’t know what it meant.

What mattered to Charlotte now was the second round. She had no time to think about anything else.

‘If Senior Helmut sees Mother, will he recognize her? Did he perhaps like her in the past?’

That was all she thought. Helmut remained expressionless.

After dropping the hint, Charlotte stepped back. Helmut glanced at her briefly before boarding the carriage.

Though he looked calm, his heart was racing.

‘Today… she’s coming to watch the tournament.’

An unexpected situation had found him again. His steps wavered slightly as he boarded the carriage.



H.F.C Chapter 229 (Part 2):
				The arena was particularly noisy today. It was because of a rare distinguished guest.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa. Her visit had now become official.

Rumors spread through the mouths of those who glimpsed her as she got out of the carriage.

An elegant lady with impressive blonde hair. Her appearance was unmistakable.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa was highly popular among the principality’s people.

She was the ideal queen everyone thought of, the center of Ratona’s social circles.

Although she didn’t enjoy public activities, even her quiet nature was highly regarded.

The audience buzzed among themselves.

“Look up there. They say the Grand Duchess of Renosa is inside where those knights are standing.”

“The Grand Duchess of Renosa? Unexpected. I heard she’s not one to attend such events.”

“And it’s not even a senior match. Why would she come to watch the junior match?”

“Maybe because there’s relatively less audience, she decided to help with the tournament’s popularity? After all, this tournament is organized by the Grand Duchy of Renosa.”

“I heard the tickets sold like hotcakes once it was rumored she’d attend. But what’s the point? It’s not like she’ll wave to us from the railing.”

“Look at that awning. There’s no way she’d show herself outside. She’ll watch the match quietly from inside.”

“They say she showed herself yesterday. Maybe she was surprised because that girl Charlotte got hurt.”

“Really? Then we might see her today too?”

“Is there an exciting match today that would interest the Grand Duchess?”

“Well, there’s that handsome guy Helmut’s match, isn’t he rumored to be the tournament favorite?”

“He beat his opponent with just the sword sheath? Completely toyed with him?”

“That’s something. It’s worth looking forward to. Junior matches are usually dull compared to senior matches.”

“They end quickly, that’s the problem. Can’t get our money’s worth for the tickets.”

“That’s true.”

Laughter erupted among them.

It was almost time for the match to start.

The audience was abuzz to the point of being headache-inducing.

Surrounded by noise, the Grand Duchess of Renosa held her forehead.

Her elegantly styled blonde hair shone brilliantly today as well.

A maid brought out warm tea and spoke worriedly.

“Do you have a headache? People rushed to buy tickets and filled the stands upon hearing you were coming.”

“Really? If many came to see me, I should greet them.”

“You don’t have to. You should take care of yourself.”

“I’m not sick. Just a bit…”

Margret frowned. Anxiety and tension rose, making her chest feel heavy.

The closer it got to the start of the match, the more so.

The stage was more visible from here than from the stands. A chance to see that boy from yesterday more closely. Even if from quite a distance.

“Is it still far from starting?”

“Oh, it’s starting soon. Look, Your Grace, the participants are coming up.”

Margret looked down at the stage. A sturdy boy with brown hair went up first, and across from him…

She saw a boy.

Black hair like crow feathers. Deep, striking black eyes. A boy with pale skin.

Margret immediately knew. He was the boy from yesterday.

‘Helmut…’

Margret bit her lip. She knew that name all too well.

It was the name given to her first child.

A child who left his mother’s embrace to die before he could truly live in this world.

A child she had no choice but to abandon.

If her first son Helmut had grown up, he would have grown like that boy.

But he died in the Forest of Roots and could never come back.

Margret had buried that child in her heart.

But now, here was a boy the same age, with the same name, and even a similar appearance. Was this a coincidence?

Margret involuntarily sighed.

“He resembles…”

The maid cautiously responded.

“Indeed, he looks a lot like Your Grace’s family… Could he be a distant relative of the Grand Ducal family?”

Perhaps she thought Helmut resembled the Grand Duke.

Helmut’s existence was buried in darkness. Few in the Grand Duchy knew about it.

Those who knew thought Margret’s first child was stillborn.

It wasn’t entirely a lie. Her first child wasn’t born dead but died after birth.

Margret slowly closed and opened her eyes. Her lips parted.

“Before it starts, I should greet them.”



H.F.C Chapter 230 (Part 1):
				“Look over there! The Grand Duchess is coming out.”

The audience stands instantly buzzed with excitement. A dignified blonde noblewoman walked out from under the canopy.

It was Margret, the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Her rare public appearances made her presence even more noteworthy on such an official occasion.

With a gentle smile, she elegantly waved at the crowd. The audience responded with loud applause and cheers.

The knights guarding the Grand Duchess were tense, ready for any unexpected incidents.

Her gaze naturally shifted downward to the arena below.

Two young boys were standing there, about to begin their match.

Their eyes met simultaneously. The two participants of the swordsmanship contest looked up at the Grand Duchess.

One quickly realized his rudeness, lowered his head, and bowed like a knight, but the other did not.

The boy with black hair stared boldly up at her without concern for manners.

His eyes were as dark as raven feathers, intense and seemingly swallowed by darkness.

Their gazes met again, closer than before.

To the Grand Duchess standing at the railing, the presence of that boy filled the empty stage entirely.

Her eyes trembled slightly as she scanned his face.

He bore a striking resemblance. To the Grand Duke, to Charlotte, and to that baby.

Margret had once imagined what that child would look like when he grew up.

The boy named Helmut looked exactly like that image. It was astonishing, so perfect that it seemed impossible he wasn’t the same person.

‘If that child had grown up, he would look like this.’

Her eyes stung and her chest ached. She couldn’t understand anymore.

Her child was dead. A dead child could not come back to life, yet Margret felt as if her dead child had returned.

She felt strange about herself. However, Margret’s turmoil did not show any further.

With a smile befitting the Grand Duchess of Renosa, she looked down and then turned away.

As she disappeared into the canopy, the conversation about her subsided quickly.

The arena soon regained its previous atmosphere.

Helmut slowly closed and opened his eyes.

It was her. No doubt. He had found her. His heart trembled.

He felt as if he had finally come home. Every cell in his body felt alive.

A shout came from the side.

“We’re starting soon. Get ready!”

His opponent looked like just another obstacle to be crushed.

But he knew he couldn’t kill him. He clung to that single thread of awareness.

This was Renosa, and his mother was watching.

Helmut, who had been contemplating how to lose naturally, had gone.

Defeat was not a word he could accept.

It was an absolute pull and will that couldn’t be reasoned with.

Whether it was the temple or anything else, it didn’t matter. There were moments when it was inevitable.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa had come to this swordsmanship tournament.

His mother was watching.

He couldn’t show her defeat. Never.

A flash of determination crossed Helmut’s eyes.

The next moment, his will was expressed through his sword.

Clang! The sword slipped out of his opponent’s grasp and clattered pathetically to the ground.

His opponent’s widened pupils reflected confusion and incomprehension.

Then, seeing his fallen sword, his eyes filled with despair.

What followed was fear.

This was a real fight. If this had been a battlefield, he would not have survived.

Not only had his opponent disarmed him, but he would have also slit his throat.

The black-haired boy’s cold gaze and unhesitating sword were enough to evoke primal fear.

It was like standing before the Grim Reaper.

‘W-What kind of guy is this?’

Could an academy student possibly display such prowess?

His opponent wondered. He, too, had won far more battles than he had lost and was regarded as one of the best of his age.

But evaluations and talent aside, the boy in front of him was different.

He was no longer just an unpolished gem in the making.

Academy students were incomplete, constantly being hammered and refined into swords.

But Helmut was already a sword.

There were very few who could be described as swords themselves. No, extremely few.

But one of those extremely few was here. In the form of a mere fifteen-year-old boy.

That vast and absolute presence. It made his opponent tremble with awe.

‘How… can such a young boy…’

But he acknowledged his defeat. He couldn’t deny it. His opponent quickly accepted it.

While pondering the mystery of the boy named Helmut. The mystery was not his alone.

But in any case, Helmut had won. Again, as if it were familiar. Just as he had intended.

A different outcome would have been nearly miraculous from the start.



H.F.C Chapter 230 (Part 2):
				Helmut raised his head and looked at the audience with his black eyes.

His gaze, containing a hidden flame within the ice, seemed arrogant.

But the arrogance of a victor was natural. Even though this was not Basor but Renosa, at this moment, no one could deny Helmut.

Waaahhhh! Loud cheers strike the stage.

Again.

This time, he didn’t make the conspicuous move of striking his opponent with his sword sheath.

He simply swung his sword, disarmed his opponent, and pointed his sword at him.

His opponent stood helpless before him, as if stripped naked.

Helmut had made it so.

‘I must win.’

As if it were obvious, Helmut muttered to himself. He wanted to show it.

It wasn’t vanity or arrogance. Just as in Basor, he liked winning.

He liked the feeling of having his existence and strength acknowledged and confirmed.

The audience began cheering for him wildly, and that cheer would likely continue until Helmut was crowned champion.

And his mother was watching.

It felt like he had left the Forest of Roots for this moment. Perhaps that was indeed the truth.

Helmut’s gaze moved upward. The inside of the canopy was quiet.

But he felt a gaze directed at him from inside.

He couldn’t know what it was, but his mother was agitated.

Was she also instinctively feeling it?

If he won the swordsmanship contest, he might meet the members of the Grand Duchy.

His mother would probably be there. No, she definitely would be.

If she had seen Helmut, she would want to confirm it.

He didn’t know if he could reveal the truth.

But Helmut finally felt certain about what he needed to do.

He had to win.

Helmut bowed his head toward the Grand Duchess, as if apologizing for his earlier rudeness.

Applause poured out.

Margret clenched and unclenched her hands several times. Her gaze wandered anxiously in the air.

Even when Michael had collapsed, she had never felt such an emotional upheaval.

Since losing her first child fifteen years ago, she had lived quietly, like a calm lake, despite the despair, pain, and sorrow she had endured.

As the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

But now, a stone had been thrown into her lake.

A maid asked worriedly,

“Your Grace, why do you look so restless?”

The maid was concerned that the Grand Duchess might be shocked by doubts about the Grand Duke’s fidelity.

In Renosa, those who knew the Grand Duke’s face would start to harbor such suspicions one by one.

It was terrifying talent and skill for an ordinary commoner boy to possess.

Margret made up her mind and spoke.

“I must meet that boy.”

“Your Grace, shall I send someone to bring him here?”

But Margret shook her head firmly and stopped her.

“No! No. I cannot meet a tournament participant privately… That would not be proper.”

It was something she couldn’t tell anyone. Not even the absent Grand Duke.

It was a truth she couldn’t reveal to Michael or Charlotte.

They didn’t know how their eldest brother had died. They had only vaguely heard that there was a stillborn child.

Margret had never once let them see the grief she had experienced in the past.

Helmut had been buried and dead in her heart.

But it was as if a corpse had walked out of the grave, as if he had been pulled out of the tomb in her heart.

The lady-in-waiting gently suggested,

“Don’t worry, Your Grace. We can bring him secretly.”

“No… If someone were to see him, there would be unnecessary rumors. False rumors.”

She couldn’t act recklessly. Margret quickly came to a decision on what to do.

With a look befitting a wise Grand Duchess, she spoke.

“I must observe this tournament further.”

“I will clear your schedule.”

“Good, and… is Charlotte here? There are too many people in the audience.”

“I have kept track of Lady Charlotte’s whereabouts. Shall I call her over?”

“Yes, please do.”

Margret closed her eyes. Numerous emotions and anguish were etched on her elegant brow.

*

“Isn’t he amazing? Senior Helmut.”

Charlotte, who had just been called, was excited. She spoke as if watching the exploits of a very close friend, her own brother.

Even if it had been Michael, she wouldn’t have reacted like this.

To Margret, Charlotte’s reaction felt surprisingly significant.

Margret spoke warmly but clearly, drawing a line.

“Yes, he is quite an impressive commoner for you to praise him so highly. To achieve victory with a single swing of his sword. It was impressive.”

“Mother, status doesn’t matter at the academy. Senior Helmut is a swordsman I respect.”

“Yes, I understand. You seem to be quite close with him.”

“Yes, we’ve dueled before and were in the same selection group.”

Charlotte nodded cheerfully. Margret naturally inquired,

“Then you must know him well. Could you tell me more about him?”

“So, Mother is interested in Senior Helmut too? Well, Senior Helmut…”

Charlotte chatted away about the rumors and academy life of Helmut.



H.F.C Chapter 231 (Part 1):
				Charlotte didn’t know much about Helmut.

He was the top student in the second year of the swordsmanship department, extremely diligent, and of a cool-headed disposition, often silent. He was well-regarded by the instructors and was a central figure among his peers.

As she spoke these words, Charlotte saw Helmut in a new light.

Except for his surface-level status as a commoner, Helmut was nearly perfect. It was astonishingly refreshing.

However, she didn’t feel any particular thrill or attraction towards him.

Even as she listed his strengths that she was aware of, and even as she looked up to him and conversed with him, she felt that way.

This was something Charlotte, who had little interest in others, found oddly intriguing.

‘If I had to say, it’s a sense of familiarity… But why?’

Charlotte did not forget that they were senior and junior in the Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department, nor did she forget that she was the Duchess of Renosa.

Upon graduation, they would merely be a commoner and a noble. Therefore, it was strange to feel a sense of closeness.

Yet, Charlotte felt a natural ease in speaking to Helmut, a senior whom everyone else seemed to avoid. It came naturally.

‘Could it be that I like that senior?’

An absurd question popped into her mind. But it didn’t seem to be the case.

Charlotte had never felt her heart race when she looked at him.

In fact, she always felt calm when she was with him. Even more than with her brother, Michael.

“What’s wrong? Is there something else on your mind?”

“No, um, I think Helmut will win. Among the Greta Academy selected representatives, Helmut is the strongest. He’s strong enough to easily defeat the senior selected representatives.”

“That’s impressive at such a young age.”

Margaret nodded, looking complicated. But she asked calmly, not showing her true feelings.

“Do you know where he’s from or where he lived? He might be related to Rinosa.”

Charlotte’s thoughts did not reach the doubting of her father’s loyalty. She shook her head.

“I don’t know. Helmut doesn’t reveal much about himself. I’ve heard he was raised by a swordsman who was friends with Instructor Ethan. He seemed to have grown up in a remote place, not near Renosa.”

“I see.”

Margaret fell into deep thought. Charlotte found it novel to see her mother so attentive to her words.

Seeing Margaret show interest in Helmut, words naturally flowed from Charlotte’s mouth.

Charlotte wanted to impress her mother. She had always craved her mother’s affection, which had been focused on Michael. The words spilled out naturally.

“I don’t know if I should say this…”

She hadn’t thought about it because of the upcoming tournament, but it had once been a concern for her.

Helmut had acted secretive, making it uncomfortable to talk about it.

However, no matter how significant a secret was, one tends to spill everything in front of their mother.

After a brief hesitation, Charlotte spoke.

“Margaret Irene. Isn’t that your maiden name, Mother?”

“Yes, I am from the Irene Marquis family.”

“But… Helmut knew that name. Margaret Irene. He asked me if I knew that name.”

“…What?”

Margaret’s reaction was a beat late. Charlotte frowned slightly.

“But isn’t it strange? When you were in the County, Helmut hadn’t even been born yet. How does he know your maiden name when he doesn’t know you’re the Grand Duchess of Rinosa? He clearly told me, ‘I saw a lady like that by chance before, and you resemble her.'”

After a moment of silence, Charlotte spoke again.

“Did you ever leave Rinosa, Mother? Did you see him when you visited your hometown?”

“…I did visit my hometown once, but in secret, and I didn’t go out.”

“Then how… Has he been to Renosa? How does he know your maiden name?”

The questions grew more and more. Margaret asked Charlotte calmly, with strangely serene eyes.

“Does he know you are the Duchess of Renosa?”

“No, he probably doesn’t. But he saw you today and knows the Grand Duchess of Rinosa is the owner of that name, so he might guess who I am. He seemed convinced that I’m related to you.”

Charlotte, realizing she had slipped up, looked embarrassed.

“It doesn’t seem like he would tell anyone else, but I should still ask him to keep it a secret.”

“Yes, do that.”

Margaret’s gaze moved hazily towards the window as if looking at a distant place.

A whisper-like sound flowed from her mouth.

“That boy might have seen my portrait. The portrait of the Irene Marquis’ daughter.”

Charlotte exclaimed in realization.

“Ah! That makes sense. It could have been a portrait he saw by chance. Then it’s natural he wouldn’t know you are the Grand Duchess of Renosa.”

After a few more words, Charlotte stood up.

“I’ll be going now.”

“I look forward to seeing you again at the palace.”

“Should I ask Helmut directly?”

“No, you don’t need to. I plan to meet him myself soon. If he is as talented as you say, he will win this tournament.”

“Right. Meeting the Grand Duchess of Renosa as the champion… It’s a fitting occasion.”

Charlotte bowed and left. A maid discreetly guided her out.



H.F.C Chapter 231 (Part 2):
				Now only Margaret remained in the room.

The elegant and serene face of the lady showed a change. The hidden agitation momentarily took over her expression.

Margaret blinked slowly with an indescribable expression. Her fingertips trembled.

Margaret vividly remembered the scene 15 years ago when she let go of her child. The pendant abandoned with the child.

A pendant given by a mother to her child had her maiden name engraved on it.

The flow of thoughts naturally continued in Margaret’s mind.

It was unbelievable, but…

She couldn’t dismiss the possibility.

The assumption that her first child, abandoned in the Forest of Roots, had returned alive!

If that were true…

Margaret closed her eyes tightly.

*

That night, Helmut was facing Alea again.

She was currently the only person with whom he could share his joy or sorrow.

Though she seemed to anticipate everything, this time, Alea was genuinely surprised.

“So, the Grand Duchess of Renosa is your mother?”

“There’s no doubt.”

“Did your mother… recognize you?”

“I don’t know. She seemed agitated. But isn’t it hard to believe that the child abandoned in the Forest of Roots would return alive?”

“Yeah, you are the first. And to be honest, I don’t know how your mother would react to that fact. It’s a dangerous situation, isn’t it?”

Alea spoke cautiously, as if advising him to be careful. She knew the physiology of nobles well.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa had her first child taken away because he carried the Seed of Darkness.

But did she resist? As the Grand Duchess of Renosa, she would have accepted it due to duty, pressure, or whatever reason.

It probably hasn’t changed even now.

Instead of instilling caution towards his mother, Alea subtly inquired.

“Of course, the temple doesn’t know you carry the Seed of Darkness. But do you plan to reveal it to your mother?”

“…I don’t know.”

Helmut hesitated. But his expression soon turned resolute.

“I must win this tournament.”

Alea, about to point out the danger, paused.

She understood why Helmut was so determined.

Logically, it was right to discourage him. If it was true that the Grand Duchess of Renosa was agitated by Helmut, then he had already strongly made his existence known to her.

Wouldn’t she want to converse with the boy who resembled her deceased first child at least once? His goal could be achieved this way too.

“Or you could approach through Charlotte, the Duchess of Renosa.”

There were smoother ways to go about it.

But what brought Helmut this far wasn’t reason. It was desire and longing.

The longing to find his mother who had cried out for him before their separation drove Helmut.

Alea didn’t fail to understand what Helmut wanted to prove and show his mother.

There are times when one must take some risks for the sake of their life’s goal.

Whether this was a risk worth taking, even Alea didn’t know.

But it was Helmut’s decision to make.

He would undoubtedly attract attention in this swordsmanship tournament, and two high priests were heading to Renosa. Advising him to hide was the logical choice, wasn’t it?

But Alea didn’t stop him. Because she also wished for Helmut’s victory.

It was a trivial reason. Alea placed absolute value on being number one.

If she did something, she must be the best. Alea took that for granted.

“Yes, win.”

Alea answered with a bright smile.

*

The next day, after winning the second round, Charlotte immediately sought out Helmut.

Until then, she hadn’t approached him to stay focused on the tournament.

Charlotte had never explicitly said that Margaret Irene was her mother, but she thought Helmut could guess.

But since Helmut wasn’t talkative, she didn’t think he would tell anyone that she was a Duchess.

“Um, senior. I have something to tell you.”

When Charlotte cautiously approached him in the training ground, Helmut immediately turned to her.

“What is it?”

“Did you… meet her yesterday at the swordsmanship tournament…”

“Are you talking about the Grand Duchess of Renosa?”

“Yes, did you happen to see her before?”

Charlotte was careful. She was indirectly asking if he knew Margaret Irene was the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

There was a difficult barrier of truth between them.

Though his sister, Charlotte wasn’t on his side. He couldn’t trust her easily.

After a brief contemplation, Helmut decided to feign ignorance.

“She was an elegant lady.”

But it meant he didn’t know. It was natural to be suspicious. Helmut had said he had seen Margaret Irene.

But if Charlotte asked where he saw the Grand Duchess of Renosa, he would be at a loss for an answer.

About knowing the name Margaret Irene.

Helmut had learned that Margaret was no longer called by that name.



H.F.C Chapter 232 (Part 1):
				Charlotte was confused.

‘Does he not know my mother? Then how does he know the name Margaret Irene? And why did he say I resembled her?’

Helmut didn’t seem like someone who would lie.

But something felt off. Before she could ask more, Helmut quickly ended the conversation.

“I want to focus on training now.”

Helmut had another match tomorrow. For those selected from Greta Academy, the match took priority.

Charlotte nodded and stepped back.

“Oh, okay.”

As she left, still mired in doubt, Charlotte realized something. Helmut was hiding something.

It was about her mother. Charlotte’s gaze grew serious.

‘Could it be something that would harm my mother or Renosa?’

If that were the case, she couldn’t leave it alone. But it didn’t seem likely.

Was knowing her maiden name really that significant?

‘The tournament comes first for now.’

They were in the semifinals. Charlotte was aware of how lucky she had been.

Her next opponent was tough. Robin from Matesis Academy, whom she had previously clashed with at the training ground.

Though Taren, a more skilled opponent, was eliminated, it was because he faced Helmut.

If not for that, Taren would have been a strong contender for the championship.

Robin wasn’t much weaker than Taren.

Which meant Robin was stronger than Charlotte, who was just a first-year.

Robin was a championship contender, second only to Helmut.

Charlotte watched Robin’s matches for analysis. And she realized Robin was stronger than her.

Until now, she had fought and won against opponents she thought were stronger than herself.

It was due to her effort, her luck, and the fact that her opponents underestimated her.

Charlotte’s skills were now proven by reaching the semifinals, and her opponents knew her abilities.

They knew her small stature and unique fighting style.

She wasn’t confident. But even without confidence, she wanted to reach the finals.

It would bring great honor to Greta Academy and herself.

She was the duchess of Renosa, and this was the capital, Ratona.

‘For now, I should think about how to win this match.’

Of course, winning the championship would be even better.

But Charlotte didn’t think she could defeat Helmut. Compared to him, her next opponent seemed more possible.

Charlotte set aside her doubts about Helmut. It was her mother’s matter to deal with.

*

That night, Helmut’s crystal ball lit up.

It was a message from Talon.

“I’ve delivered the documents to the Mercenary Guild.”

With a brief message, Helmut nodded.

Now, he had one chance left. One chance to get information from Black Hawk. He had to use it very carefully.

Helmut went straight to the Mercenary Guild to retrieve the documents, moving stealthily to avoid detection.

Back in his room with the documents, Helmut quickly scanned through them.

He had ordered a thorough investigation of the current Renosa Grand Duchy.

“Members of the Renosa Grand Duchy.”

The list contained the names of everyone bearing the Renosa surname, whether directly or through branch families.

Though he skimmed through it, Helmut’s name was not there. He had likely been erased from the family records.

It wasn’t particularly bitter.

That was the fate of a child with the Seed of Darkness. To be erased immediately upon discovery at birth.

But fate failed to erase him.

Helmut had returned to the place of his birth, escaping the fate meant for a child with the Seed of Darkness.

Or was this also fate? Helmut wanted to decide the end of this fate with his own hands. That’s why he became stronger.

Lost in thought, Helmut flipped through the documents.

His eyes stopped on a familiar name. He hadn’t noticed it while looking for his own name, but it was there in the list.

“Michael.”

The name was listed as a direct descendant of the Renosa Grand Duchy, alongside Charlotte’s.

At the sight of the name, Helmut frowned.

‘He is…my brother.’

It flowed naturally, allowing comprehension – why he had been unusually generous towards Michael, despite him not being a descendant of Darien who owed Helmut a debt like Luke Yeager.

There had been a moment when Helmut felt reluctant to silence Michael if he caught on, unlike his usual ruthlessness.

Helmut knew well that he was a cold-hearted person.

Most people don’t consider killing or sparing a life so easily.

But beyond Michael’s kindness.

Michael had something that made him reluctant to act against him. Blood was indeed thick. They were twins.

‘Michael resembles our mother.’

Though he hadn’t been aware of it, it seemed that way. He knew Michael wasn’t a good or trustworthy person.

Telling him the truth would be hard. He hadn’t even decided whether to tell their mother.

Even without familial affection, it felt strange.



H.F.C Chapter 232 (Part 2):
				Helmut slowly read through the documents. They contained quite detailed information.

That Charlotte was studying at Greta Academy, that she didn’t get along with Michael.

Michael and Charlotte were in a competitive relationship, but Michael was the likely heir since Charlotte wasn’t ambitious.

And about the favoritism of the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

‘Favoritism… Is that why Charlotte is pushing herself so hard?’

Knowing they were family made Helmut more interested in Charlotte.

As if someone had given him permission.

Charlotte was extremely diligent. She spent the most time training with the sword in the dormitory.

Her efforts weren’t just about being earnest.

She seemed to want someone’s recognition. As if she wanted to be seen.

She was one of the most desperate participants in this swordsmanship tournament.

‘For our mother…’

Just as Helmut wanted to prove himself to her, Charlotte must feel the same.

He realized one more thing.

‘Was it Michael who took Charlotte away back then?’

Charlotte and Michael didn’t get along on the surface. Charlotte seemed troubled.

Michael’s reason for taking her was likely to show off his influence within Renosa.

That’s why he used the Black Wing Knights to bring her in as a guest.

Knowing that his two siblings, whom he didn’t even know existed, didn’t get along, made Helmut feel strange.

He never expected a warm, harmonious family waiting for him outside the Forest of Roots, but he hadn’t anticipated discord either.

‘If the two fight……’

He wouldn’t take sides, but Michael had tried to recruit him.

Having reached the semifinals in the swordsmanship tournament, he would soon draw attention. If he won, he would inevitably face Michael.

‘Michael didn’t show up at the tournament, either because he’s interested in the senior tournament or because he’s ill.’

That was an accurate analysis. Michael, who seemed to have recovered, fell ill again after the Grand Duchess of Renosa’s visit.

He was too ill to care about the swordsmanship tournament.

Though the Grand Duchess visited him daily, she didn’t cling to him as before, as if her mind was elsewhere.

Helmut thought about his two siblings. Two completely different people, Charlotte and Michael.

Just because they had the same hair color didn’t mean they were on the same side, but he felt Charlotte would be more favorable to his presence.

‘But Michael likely wouldn’t welcome the existence of a brother.’

Even if he held goodwill towards Hyde, learning that Hyde was Helmut would change things.

The reason was simple. Hyde was highly skilled. Michael wanted Hyde as a subordinate, not as a sibling.

Michael, who was wary of Charlotte, would find it hard to show the same goodwill upon learning the truth.

Michael was certainly a formidable opponent. Quick-witted and smart.

If he was close to their mother, revealing that he had returned alive from the Forest of Roots to her wouldn’t be wise.

Their mother wouldn’t speak out until she was sure.

A child with the Seed of Darkness was someone whose existence shouldn’t be known, someone to be buried.

Helmut decided to remain calm. His heart was passionate, but his reason was cold.

Alea, who he conversed with daily, always made his reason clear.

Even if a child who had died and come back was dear, he wouldn’t be dearer than the one who had always been by her side.

‘For now….. it’s best to observe the situation.’

Just hinting at his existence to their mother was enough. Helmut wasn’t yet strong enough to fight the temple.

Helmut made his decision, but whether he could follow it smoothly was uncertain.

*

The next day, the Grand Duchess of Renosa came to the tournament venue again. She wanted to avoid showing that she was particularly watching someone, so she had to watch all the matches in the junior tournament.

As if she had taken an interest in the swordsmanship tournament. Today was Charlotte’s match.

The Grand Duchess even turned down Michael’s request.

‘Mother, won’t you stay by my side today? I’m not feeling well……’

It was the first time she could turn away from his pleading blue eyes with a feeling of guilt.

Margaret had a hard time refusing Michael’s requests because she was weak to him.

But now, something more important occupied her mind. Even though the boy wasn’t competing today, he might visit the venue.

And just like last time, there could be danger, and she was worried about Charlotte facing a tough match.

‘If she gets hurt… A match with real swords!’

Michael didn’t want her to be interested in Charlotte.

So he often used his illness to attract Margaret’s attention.

Margaret knew that too. She knew but couldn’t help it. She was the one who gave birth to the sickly Michael.

He was a pitiable child who was often ill enough to be close to death from a young age.

Relative to that, Charlotte’s health made her less worried.

She was grateful that Charlotte had grown up well even with less attention.



H.F.C Chapter 233 (Part 1):
				‘That child also made a lot of effort.’

Margret knew how impressive it was to become a selected participant in the swordsmanship competition within less than a year of entering the academy.

Charlotte had always been a diligent and steadfast child. A faint smile appeared on Margret’s lips.

There isn’t a finger that doesn’t hurt when bitten, but not all fingers hurt equally.

There were less painful fingers and more painful fingers.

For Margret, Michael was the more painful finger. But that didn’t make the less painful fingers meaningless.

At this moment, Margret’s gaze was on the less painful finger.

Her eyes turned towards the stage. Two selected participants were standing there. One was Charlotte, and the other one was…

“What are you worried about? Do you have the mind to think about other things?”

Robin asked sarcastically, looking at Charlotte, who had her gaze upward.

After Taren was brutally defeated by Helmut and eliminated, he alone bore the honor of the swordsmanship department of Matesis Academy.

He had watched the match between Helmut and Taren.

Helmut’s skills were real. His sword was so fast and harsh that it gave chills. Robin thought he wouldn’t have had a different outcome than Taren.

But this girl, Charlotte, was different.

Robin judged that Helmut was abnormal, but everyone else was at an ordinary level.

Even if they were excellent, they weren’t overwhelmingly so in this swordsmanship competition.

Among such excellence, it was natural for Robin, from Matesis Academy, to stand out the most.

‘A small frame, agile movements. She’s not an easy opponent. Moreover, she’s a pretty and seemingly weak girl, so anyone might hesitate and end up getting hurt.

Looking at how far she’s come, she must have some skills, but can I really lose to her?’

Anyone would let their guard down in front of Charlotte. Robin wasn’t completely relaxed, but he didn’t place Charlotte on the same level as himself.

He would surely teach her a lesson. Even if there was that one genius, the rest would show that Matesis was superior to Greta!

Robin smiled as if he were certain of victory.

“This is a glorious stage watched by the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Let’s have a great match together.”

Charlotte finally responded.

“Yes, indeed.”

Her gaze that had been toward the Grand Duchess returned to its original position. This was the stage watched by her mother. Her heart raced with excitement.

Somehow, she didn’t feel like she would lose. Renosa’s Ratona was Charlotte’s home stage.

Everything seemed to be on her side. Even the air and wind swirling around this place.

Charlotte gripped her sword handle. Her heart, filled with determination and confidence, was rather calm.

Early this morning, she had a sparring session with Helmut. He had proposed it himself.

Helmut was not the type to propose sparring with anyone. To him, sparring with someone was meaningless.

When she asked why he was helping her, Helmut replied,

“It’s also good for me if you reach the final stage.”

That didn’t mean he helped her because she was an easy opponent compared to Robin.

To Helmut, both Charlotte and Robin were similar opponents.

Helmut had simply lowered his skills to an appropriate level to spar with her.

Even so, it was still challenging for Charlotte to deal with him.

Charlotte told Helmut,

“I will achieve good results to make your help worthwhile.”

She intended to keep that promise. Charlotte’s eyes firmly fixed on her opponent.

Soon, the match began.

Waaaaaah!

Excited cheers hit the stage. The match continued for over 30 minutes. This meant there wasn’t much difference in their skills.

Robin seemed to have better endurance, but Charlotte’s endurance was not inferior.

The seemingly endless match saw a decisive moment when the impatient Robin made a move.

Robin’s sword grazed Charlotte’s shoulder. It was an unavoidable strike.

Red blood splattered onto the stage.

A woman stood up abruptly from the shaded area.

Her shoulder was burning, and her head soon felt dizzy.

Yet Charlotte kept her hawk-like sharp gaze locked on her sword.

Blood could be seen dripping from her opponent’s neck. It was where the tip of her sword had grazed.

The impact of her injury had nearly caused her to falter, but she succeeded in not fatally wounding him.

And she won. She won.



H.F.C Chapter 233 (Part 2):
				Charlotte’s gaze was intensely piercing at that moment.

Waaaaaaah! Cheers erupted again. Robin looked at Charlotte with a pale face.

His jaw clenched. However, regardless of what resistance he felt, he had to accept the result.

Charlotte had laid a trap, and Robin, who had patiently identified traps from the start, eventually lost his patience in the prolonged match.

He attacked Charlotte’s shoulder and, in return, exposed his neck.

“You should get treated immediately.”

The attendants who came up with worried faces led Charlotte away for simple first aid treatment.

Charlotte briefly glanced up at where her mother was, then followed them off the stage. She felt a sense of relief.

She had done it. In front of her mother. Even though she did not reveal that she was the Duchess of Renosa, in front of everyone.

Charlotte thus secured her spot in the finals of the academy’s comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Before Helmut. Helmut, watching from the audience, frowned.

‘So I’ll be facing Charlotte.’

The irony of facing his younger sister in front of their mother. But there was also a reason he had helped Charlotte.

He wanted Charlotte to reach the finals. His mother would want that too.

There was another calculation as well. When their mother sees the pair of a young boy and girl who resemble each other pointing swords at each other, what would she think of?

When she sees the boy who resembles Charlotte and is older than her, would she be reminded of her lost son?

Michael would probably appear there too. Although the attention would be more on the senior matches relatively, the finals were a different story.

‘Will Michael recognize me?’

Helmut thought it was highly likely.

If his instinctive pull towards blood relations was the reason he had been generous to Michael, then Michael may have felt the same towards Helmut as well.

Not just out of desire for a skilled swordsman, but something more.

If Michael sensed Hyde in Helmut, he would immediately connect Helmut to Hyde.

Michael wasn’t just smart; he had intuition.

However, even if Michael felt that pull towards blood relations, if he truly realized Helmut was a blood relation, he would not welcome that fact.

It was inevitable that Helmut would face Michael.

But Helmut had thought that not only his mother, but Michael too might get a strange feeling upon seeing Helmut’s resemblance to Charlotte.

Might Michael sense something unknown to him through that intuition?

As the most cherished child of his mother, would Michael know the truth that Charlotte didn’t?

If he knew about the stillborn older brother, and if he suspected and investigated his survival.

‘For now, I have to face them.’

Now only the semifinals and finals remained. It would only be after completing that final act on the brightly lit stage that Helmut would finally face his mother and Michael.

Helmut still had a safer option.

If he was eliminated in the semifinals, he would receive relatively less attention.

But he didn’t feel like doing that. He intended to reveal himself and confront directly. His resolve hadn’t changed.

Helmut stood up. The area around his mother, which had been noisy for a moment, was now calm.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa had left. It was plain as day where she had headed.

‘The dormitory must be festive.’

Since two representatives from Greta Academy would face each other in the finals, the Greta Academy faculty would be overjoyed.

Perhaps this would be the first and last gift Helmut would give them.

That’s how he felt.

“The bleeding has stopped, and the wound will heal soon. Take this medicine. It will help the flesh to grow back.”

Charlotte frowned as she swallowed the bitter medicine.

Due to the blood loss, she felt dizzy.

But Charlotte was in a good mood. She had come much farther than she initially expected. As if luck was on her side.

Things were going well. Her mother was watching her in this tournament.

She could even feel her mother’s worried gaze from afar.

Charlotte’s efforts were being rewarded.

As she caught her breath, she suddenly sensed the footsteps of several people approaching.

Soon, the door to the treatment room where Charlotte was opened. A noblewoman with dignified golden hair stood there, her face pale.

“Your Highness, the Grand Duchess! How could you come to such a place?”

The swordsmanship tournament attendants hurriedly bowed their heads.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa stepped into the waiting room with elegant but quick steps.

She had rushed over without a second thought, but regained her composure along the way. It was excessive for her to come looking for Charlotte. But it could be managed.

Margret spoke in a stern tone.

“Is the treatment finished? I was startled to see such a young girl injured and rushed over.”

If she were a kind-hearted noblewoman, she might rush over upon seeing an injured young girl participating in the swordsmanship tournament.

Though puzzled, everyone accepted it readily, thinking how kind she was.

“Her condition is stable. With treatment, she will recover soon.”

“I see. That’s a relief.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa, suppressing her emotions, looked towards Charlotte and commanded.

“I wish to speak with this child, so all of you leave us.”

“Yes, Your Highness, the Grand Duchess.”

With everyone leaving, only Margret and Charlotte remained.



H.F.C Chapter 234 (Part 1):
				“Oh, Charlotte. What happened to you?”

The Grand Duchess, pale and distressed, rushed over and caressed Charlotte’s cheek.

Charlotte greeted her with a smile.

“Mother, you’re here?”

Charlotte didn’t blame her mother for revealing her appearance without considering the risk of exposing her true identity.

She had already exchanged words with her mother several times before. No matter how careful she was, someone was bound to notice her eventually. But at this late stage of the tournament, it wasn’t a major issue.

It would be problematic if it became known at Greta Academy that Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Charlotte decided not to think about it any further. She was enjoying the happiest and most rewarding moment.

She had secured a spot in the finals, and her mother was completely focused on her. There was nothing more she could ask for.

Margret frowned, concern evident in her eyes.

“I don’t know if it’s right for you to wield a sword while bleeding like this. My heart nearly stopped when your shoulder got cut.”

“It’s a real sword tournament, so it couldn’t be helped. I knew I wouldn’t die, and I won.”

“Yes, well done. But I don’t want you to go through such danger again. I can hardly bear to watch. Shouldn’t you withdraw from the next match?”

They were facing the finals. If Charlotte withdrew now, the tournament would be ruined.

Margret was urging Charlotte to withdraw, disregarding the chaos it would cause to the tournament Michael had organized.

It was an unacceptable suggestion from the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

It was a mother’s plea. Margret had never spoken to Charlotte in such a manner before.

Charlotte had always thought her mother favored Michael over her, but now she realized that the reason might be different from what she had imagined.

‘Perhaps Mother is afraid of the possibility of losing her child.’

Seeing Margret’s reaction, that thought crossed Charlotte’s mind.

Looking back, Margret had always been especially attentive when Michael was ill.

It was just that Michael was often sick, which had directed Margret’s attention entirely towards him.

Margret was a noblewoman who faithfully fulfilled her role as the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

That duty took precedence over her affection for her children.

She worried about Michael’s health, but she never acted irrationally, like following him to Basor.

Charlotte had always been healthy, rarely falling ill like Michael.

Even when she did get sick, it was usually just a cold, and often when Charlotte was unwell, Michael was severely ill.

In this swordsmanship tournament, Charlotte had faced real swords and had to endure several serious injuries and near-death experiences.

Margret could not remain indifferent to that.

Charlotte calmly shook her head.

“It’s something a swordsman must endure. However… there won’t be such a thing in the next match. Helmut is far superior to me in skill. By a lot.”

There were opponents that neither luck nor perseverance could overcome.

Even if Helmut were to stagger onto the stage with a high fever, Charlotte would not be able to defeat him. That was the gap between them.

Thus, unless Helmut intended otherwise, Charlotte would not be in danger.

Helmut could win the championship without even causing Charlotte a scratch.

Probably with a single strike, as he had done so often before.

“You’re certain he will advance.”

“Yes, I won’t be able to defeat him. Not because of a lack of confidence, but because it’s a fact.”

Helmut was too strong. This kind of comprehensive swordsmanship tournament was almost trivial for him.

Margret nodded slowly.

“I’m relieved. I wanted you to win, but more than that, I prefer you to be safe.”

Margret held Charlotte’s hand and added cautiously.

“Take care of yourself.”

“Yes, mother.”

*

The next day, Helmut confirmed his advancement to the finals, as expected.

It was almost effortless. He defeated his opponent with a single strike.

Under the watchful eyes of the Grand Duchess of Renosa, Helmut wrapped up his match more composedly than usual. Now, only the finals, two days away, remained.

That night, Alea asked Helmut.

“Is your plan still the same?”

“Yes.”

After the finals, Helmut would attract unprecedented attention here in Ratona.

As the champion of the swordsmanship tournament and a bearer of Greta Academy’s honor.

Helmut’s skills were overwhelming.

Those with eyes would notice him more than the senior winner.

Given his dominance among his peers, no one knew how much more he could grow in the future.

Helmut planned to stay in Ratona for a while, leveraging his title as champion.

The Grand Duchy of Rinosa would surely give him such treatment.

“I’m not sure if this is the right thing to do.”

Alea sighed. She too was having a premonition. A premonition that Helmut had caught some kind of flow. A feeling that things wouldn’t continue smoothly like this.

As if a major event was lying ahead.

However, Helmut was still in the fog. It was difficult to imagine any situation after the final match.



H.F.C Chapter 234 (Part 2):
				Helmut tilted his head.

“I’ve heard rumors that the High Priests haven’t arrived in Rinosa yet.”

“Then something might have happened on the way.”

There was a way to track their whereabouts through Talon. But that wasn’t a good method. It would raise suspicions in Talon.

Questions about why Helmut was curious about the High Priests’ whereabouts.

‘Where on earth did they go? Has there been anything recently that would draw the attention of the temple?’

Alea also wondered. She soon spoke as if she had made up her mind.

“I’ll head to Rinosa as soon as possible.”

Alea’s eyes deepened. She had to find out.

Heike, being an Archmage, might have a way to discover something.

The final exams were now over, and Alea was on vacation. It wouldn’t be long until they met again.

Alea added with a smile.

“Good luck in the finals.”

*

Now the dormitory was empty.

Loen Academy, which hadn’t produced even a single finalist, had already left the dormitory in a dejected state.

Without leaving any greetings.

In this aspect, the academies of Baden didn’t show much unity.

Their competitive spirit was clearly evident. Because there was a sense of ranking each other, there were no gestures like shaking hands and saying, “Let’s have a fair competition.”

In contrast, Greta Academy’s achievements were remarkable.

In the senior tournament, Leon succeeded in advancing to the finals, while Nils failed.

Nils stayed at the dormitory to spar with Leon, who still had matches left, and left the dormitory yesterday.

It was vacation, so they couldn’t stay in Ratona indefinitely.

During vacation, they could finally enjoy freedom away from the academy. Everyone had their own lives.

Instructor Patricia joked,

“It’s good for the academy that the students are doing so well, but for us, it means we have to work through the vacation.”

“Well, it’s all for the best,” Professor Luxen responded with a laugh.

On the Matesis Academy side, they seemed to have something to boast about, having one finalist in the senior tournament.

All other students except for him left the dormitory immediately.

The faculty remained, but they seemed to be avoiding the Greta Academy faculty.

They too must have had to admit it. That the current Greta Academy’s sword department was superior to that of Matesis Academy.

Now the dormitory was quiet. It would become completely silent after the finals. Because everyone would leave this place.

Helmut thought about where he would stay after the finals. He could stay at an inn, but it would be too exposed.

This dormitory felt more private.

‘I hope Rinosa will provide separate accommodation or allow me to stay here.’

He intended to request it as a privilege of the winner.

If not, even through Charlotte.

Helmut looked forward to the final match with neither a heavy nor light heart.

*

The day before the finals, Michael finally managed to get out of bed.

His physical condition was still not very good. He felt languid and tired.

It was frustrating to have a body that absolutely shouldn’t overexert itself, but he had gotten used to it.

‘This time was a bit long.’

Due to the fever that prevented his head from working properly, he couldn’t attend to his duties properly.

In fact, he hadn’t done anything for the past few days. If the Grand Duke knew this fact, he might reconsider Michael’s disqualification as his successor.

Michael knew that the Grand Duke was scoring his children.

Charlotte had an absolute advantage that Michael didn’t have. Swordsmanship and health.

‘At least, if I could just avoid falling ill like this.’

Michael frowned. It was something that Michael, who was used to handling all situations as he wished, couldn’t control.

The act of becoming healthy.

Still, it was definitely better than when he was younger and couldn’t leave his sickbed. It was thanks to the magic and expensive, good medicines that were poured into him.

Michael got up. It was time to assess the situation.

Well-organized reports were placed by his bedside, ready to be viewed at any time.

As he skimmed through the reports, Michael frowned.

As he had intended, his mother had consistently watched Charlotte’s matches.

It seems she was concerned about Charlotte, who was fighting in dangerous matches, while rejecting Michael who tried to keep his mother by his side with the excuse of being sick.

It would be troublesome if her heart leaned towards Charlotte.

But he wasn’t worried. Michael knew how to draw his mother’s heart to himself.

‘The finals, huh.’

Time had passed without him properly seeing the tournament he had prepared.

Michael’s eyes fixed on the names of the finalists in the junior comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.

Charlotte and Helmut.

‘Helmut…’

A name that strangely caught his attention. He didn’t know why. Tilting his head, Michael calmly decided.

‘I should attend.’

Everything would become clear when he saw with his own eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 235 (Part 1):
				‘Helmut… Where have I heard that name before?’

In the carriage heading towards the tournament venue, Michael furrowed his brow.

He had a remarkable memory. He could recall even the fleeting moments that had brushed past him.

But nothing specific came to mind. It wasn’t a commoner’s name. It was a name that would be more fitting for a noble, even in Renosa.

Michael tapped his forehead as he tried to recall information about the person named Helmut instead of the name itself.

‘Extremely skilled. Black hair, black eyes. A handsome face that gives off a cold impression, as if he inherited the blood of Renosa.’

Michael, with his blonde hair and blue eyes, did not like his own appearance. It seemed to highlight his weakness.

Michael had always made good use of his delicate and gentle appearance.

An angelic appearance with a kind demeanor, but with a frail and pitiful side.

One of the strongest emotions that govern people is compassion.

Although no one dared to pity him, most people genuinely felt sympathy towards Michael.

That sympathy cloaked Michael in an aura of purity and goodness.

Even if his intentions were impure, he was rarely suspected.

That was Michael’s greatest weapon. Naturally, eliciting trust and affection from others, interpreting his intentions in a favorable light.

However, that very appearance, which made it easy for him to get what he wanted, didn’t quite suit someone aiming to become the Grand Duke of Renosa.

Charlotte had that appearance. An appearance that perfectly resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa.

But so what? Michael possessed something she did not.

Michael bit his fingertip.

A belated sense of anxiety welled up. While he had been bedridden, unaware of the unfolding situation, his mother’s attention had shifted to Charlotte, and Charlotte had advanced to the finals.

It was an incredible feat for a first-year student in the swordsmanship department.

It was as if she was declaring to Michael that she had achieved something he could never attain, no matter how hard he struggled.

‘How annoying.’

Michael, with a childish expression, recalled Helmut.

‘A commoner, wasn’t he? And they said he resembled Charlotte.’

Perhaps he could become a variable. If he truly is a branch family member of Rinosa.

If his exceptional swordsmanship caught the eye of the Grand Duke of Renosa, how would the Grand Duke accept this new Renosa bloodline?

It might be an overactive imagination. But it nagged at him.

‘Something doesn’t feel right.’

No matter what Michael thought, the carriage arrived safely at the tournament venue.

Michael glanced at the other carriages that had already arrived. His mother must have been notified.

A seemingly kind smile spread across Michael’s face.

“Mother.”

Soon, upon arriving at the seats prepared for the people of the grand ducal family, Michael bowed to the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

She, already seated at the head seat, opened her eyes wide.

“Michael, welcome. Are you feeling better?”

“I’ve recovered enough to come here. Since I’m hosting the tournament, I should see it through to the end.”

“I’m worried you might have overexerted yourself coming here.”

“Above all, it’s Charlotte’s match. It’s worth it.”

“Charlotte has seen blood several times on stage. In my heart, I wish she wouldn’t compete any further.”

Michael had wished the same. He hadn’t expected Charlotte to climb this high.

Had he known in advance, he might have tried to obstruct her.

The achievements she displayed would shine brightly when it was revealed she was the Duchess of Renosa.

And Michael didn’t want Charlotte to be in the spotlight. He replied with a smile.

“Since she’s reached the finals, you should watch with peace of mind. I’m worried about Charlotte too.”

Michael glanced at the stage. He had arrived at just the right time.

The two finalists were being led to the stage. Michael murmured.

“It’s about to start.”

Charlotte had a stiff expression. Was it the pressure of the final stage?

She was just one step away from winning. Though that one step was nearly impossible to take.

After all, it had been no easy feat for Charlotte to reach this point.

In that respect, Michael felt reassured by the appearance of the genius Helmut.

‘At least because of him, Charlotte won’t be able to win.’

Helmut, a second-year student at Greta Academy. He had swiftly defeated all his opponents, to the extent that it affected the tournament’s popularity, but Michael couldn’t help but feel a strange mix of irritation and fondness towards him.

Michael liked strong individuals. They were always useful as his chess pieces.

‘Regardless of the match outcome, I must meet him.’

There might be other ulterior motives, but if he’s of common birth, it would be difficult for him to refuse the wealth and honor Michael could offer.

Michael had a talent for making others desperately want what he could give.

Margret’s gaze momentarily wavered as she looked at the stage.

But she soon spoke in an elegant yet calm voice.

“Charlotte said she wouldn’t be able to win. Her opponent must be exceptionally strong. Being from the same academy, she would know better.”

“Did you meet her separately?”

Michael’s voice became slightly sharp.

Margret didn’t notice.

“Yes, I know it was rash. But I couldn’t help it after seeing her hurt. Fortunately, no rumors have spread. I’ve taken care of it.”

“That’s a relief. But that’s not like you, Mother. If it becomes known that Charlotte is the Grand Duke’s daughter of Rinosa, she’ll be exposed to even more danger.”

Perhaps Michael himself might have to create that danger if the situation calls for it.

If Margret continued to pay more attention to Charlotte, and if the Grand Duke of Renosa’s gaze started turning towards the accomplished Charlotte.

Michael’s eyes gleamed coldly. But Margret didn’t notice.

“I know.”

She seemed lost in thought, unable to continue speaking.

Michael’s gaze shifted from Charlotte to the boy on stage.



H.F.C Chapter 235 (Part 2):
				The distance from the high seat to the stage wasn’t close. But the boy’s presence was exceptional.

‘Is that Helmut?’

Michael examined him carefully.

Helmut was a boy who gave off a tense, threatening vibe. His jet-black hair and eyes enhanced that feeling.

His face was perfectly expressionless, and his relaxed posture made him seem as if he were out for a stroll.

In stark contrast to the tense Charlotte. As if he knew he would win.

Everyone who had shown such an attitude had been defeated by Charlotte in this tournament.

But Helmut exuded an air of detachment. It seemed as if the tournament was nothing to him.

‘He looks familiar somehow.’

Michael squinted. Nothing in his memory was triggered, but his face was familiar.

Michael could think of only one person he resembled.

‘The Grand Duke of Renosa. Father…’

He had heard they looked alike, but this was astonishing. Enough to truly suspect the Grand Duke’s infidelity.

Michael’s gaze captured both Helmut and Charlotte.

The pair of a boy and girl in one view looked remarkably alike.

As if they were molded into male and female versions of one being.

As if they, not Michael, were siblings.

And it wasn’t just Michael who felt this way.

“They look… just like siblings.”

Margret muttered involuntarily, then flinched in surprise.

Michael’s lips curled upwards.

“Indeed, they do look like siblings. As if he, not I, were Charlotte’s brother.”

As if he were Charlotte’s half-brother.

The hall buzzed with murmurs. Everyone was suspecting their blood relation.

Even those who knew Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

The one who resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa the most, shining brightly as the representative of Greta Academy’s swordsmanship department, appeared in Ratona. Could this be a coincidence?

Hearts were drawn to that uncertainty.

Michael disliked the potential meaning of his opponent.

But now was still the time to watch.

“This should be interesting.”

Michael’s blue eyes gleamed coldly.
