Helmut exhaled lightly. The noise surrounding him seemed to have no effect on him.

Despite his relaxed appearance, Helmut hadn’t slept a wink the previous night.

He was the type to sleep when necessary. He could fall asleep anywhere if he wanted.

But last night, that need didn’t work. His heart was strangely pounding. Beating heavily.

That throbbing lessened as he ascended the final stage.

His mind, previously overwhelmed by the beating, became clear.

This was the final stage. And his younger sister Charlotte was standing before him. In a completely tense state.

For her, she probably wanted to avoid losing miserably in front of her mother.

She wouldn’t want to be defeated in one strike like the previous opponents.

But regardless of her will, it was nearly impossible for Charlotte not to lose in one strike.

That is, unless Helmut deliberately went easy on her.

A new dilemma arose for Helmut.

‘Should I go easy on her?’

No one would want the final stage to end anticlimactically.

But if the stubborn Charlotte realizes this, wouldn’t she feel humiliated?

Helmut had to decide which was better. There wasn’t much time left to decide.

Charlotte greeted him stiffly.

“It’s an honor to face you, Senior.”

“I’ll end this without hurting you.”

Because it was in front of their mother. Not that he ever intended to hurt his sister.

Charlotte’s face wavered at Helmut’s condescending remark.

She placed her hand on the sword’s hilt, tightly pressing her lips together.

“I hope you won’t get hurt either, Senior.”

Her voice, spoken with determination, seemed to surprise even herself, but she didn’t let her expression waver. An unusually defiant look for her.

A fleeting smile appeared on Helmut’s lips.

Just like his sister.

Soon, the signal rang out.



H.F.C Chapter 236 (Part 1):
				Instinct?

The trajectory of the sword was swift like a beam of light. Charlotte clearly saw the sword flying towards her.

Her heightened concentration, which seemed to let her even feel the flow of air, made it possible. It was an odd occurrence.

Charlotte herself never thought she could read Helmut’s sword movements, even while preparing for this competition.

It was a realistic assessment.

But, unrealistically, she avoided Helmut’s first strike.

It was an unblockable sword. Helmut raised his eyebrows as he watched her perfectly react and evade the sword’s range.

“This tournament has helped you grow.”

Helmut muttered as if surprised. He didn’t particularly go easy on her. He knew that would be humiliating for Charlotte.

He believed no one except Asuka could evade even his single strike.

He didn’t overestimate his sister. While sparring with Charlotte, he never once thought she could achieve such a feat.

‘She knows how to create variables.’

That was Charlotte’s strength.

However, he couldn’t allow any more variables.

Helmut lowered his body and dug in. From Charlotte’s perspective, it must have felt like a beast was descending upon her.

Clang! The swords clashed. Charlotte gritted her teeth. She lost sensation in both hands due to the impact.

The enormous pressure felt like it was going to crush her wrists. That was the power of Vis.

Charlotte summoned Vis to resist. But it was like trying to block a waterfall with a stream. The Vis was rapidly being drained.

Rather than shaping Vis, it was purely a manifestation of physical strength.

However, when a stronger opponent clashed with such force, there was no other way to resist.

Helmut was overwhelming Charlotte with sheer force. If she relaxed even for a moment, her sword would slip from her grasp.

Although she wouldn’t get hurt as Helmut had declared, defeat would immediately follow.

The moment this balance of power broke, she needed to create an instant gap to counterattack. It was Charlotte’s only option.

But the balance mustn’t crumble completely. Otherwise, she would collapse instantly.

There was a subtle moment. A moment where she wasn’t sure if she could do it. But Charlotte was adept at seizing opportunities.

Her sword, completely drained of power, pointed downwards, and Helmut’s sword swiftly and fiercely dug in.

It aimed at her neck and pointed at it.

But Charlotte perfectly read Helmut’s intent.

At that moment, she shifted the balance and twisted her arm.

She explosively released the Vis that had been consumed merely to receive the blow, targeting the center of his body.

Just as Helmut aimed at her neck, her chest would be exposed. This sudden flexibility was her forte.

At that moment, the corner of Helmut’s mouth lifted slightly.

It seemed like a flash had just grazed by.

Clang, clang, clang!

The sword slipped from her grip and rolled on the ground.

Charlotte fell to the floor from the shock that seemed to paralyze her body.

Thud! Her knees ached as they struck the ground.

‘How…?’

Only questions lingered in her mind. Charlotte didn’t see how Helmut moved this time.

She merely followed her calculations, failed, and lost.

Waaaaaaah!

Fierce cheers hit the stage. It might have ended quickly for a final, but another factor was exciting the audience.

The appearance of the absolute strong, Helmut! Even on the final stage, he proved himself.

‘Is this the difference in skill?’

Charlotte looked at her empty hands.

She didn’t feel bitterness or regret. She had done her best, but her opponent was simply too strong.

Helmut calmly looked at her. He sheathed his sword, not a speck of dust on him.

Before and after the match, Helmut felt no change.

It was certainly a much easier competition compared to the Basor tournament.

‘I wonder if learning the Empire’s common swordsmanship was useful..’

He didn’t even have a proper chance to fully display his swordsmanship. He simply swung his sword.

That was enough.

Since leaving the Forest of Roots, the one thing he longed for was meeting an opponent he could fight with all his might.

Opponents like Darien or Elaga.

In the Forest of Roots, Helmut experienced frequent and numerous defeats.

Helmut suddenly pondered.

‘Can I still not defeat Elaga?’

If Elaga had devoured Naho, he would have become stronger, so probably not.

Elaga was not only a magical beast with immense magical power but also knew how to fight.

Elaga probably wouldn’t fear the temple even after leaving the Forest of Roots.

A somewhat unpleasant conclusion that he still had a long way to go.

Now Charlotte had something to say.

After gathering her thoughts, Charlotte spoke calmly after a moment.

“Senior, congratulations on your victory.”

Helmut extended his hand towards her.

“You did well too.”

Charlotte took Helmut’s hand and stood up, dusting off her hips.

She was in better condition than any other match before the finals.

The shock Helmut gave was temporary. Since she didn’t sustain any internal injuries, she would probably recover in a day or so.

Charlotte didn’t forget that she avoided Helmut’s first strike.

And that was something she hadn’t foreseen. She narrowed her eyes.

“Did you perhaps go easy on me?”

“If you call making sure you didn’t get hurt going easy, then yes. I’d win anyway, and you’re my junior after all.”

Helmut spoke as if it wasn’t for her sake.

But knowing it was a rare consideration from him, Charlotte suddenly harbored suspicion.

That suspicion immediately turned into words.

“Senior, you don’t happen to like me, do you?”

If he had been drinking water, he might have spat it out.



H.F.C Chapter 236 (Part 2):
				Helmut, unusually flustered, stared at Charlotte. Charlotte frowned.

“You helped with the sparring and all… Something feels off.”

‘He has been doing things he doesn’t usually do, could it be?’

It could be possible. Helmut and Charlotte didn’t have much contact within the academy.

However, since coming to Renosa for this swordsmanship tournament, their conversations had increased significantly.

No matter how indifferent Helmut was, it was natural to develop feelings for a girl you frequently talked to and spent time with.

Helmut slightly shook his head as if to wave it off.

A pointed remark that you’re not originally that kind-hearted.

That was true, but Helmut, who didn’t actually like Charlotte, slowly denied it.

“…No.”

“I know you’re indifferent. But coming to this swordsmanship tournament with me, you might have developed affection and grown fond of me, right?”

It seemed she was questioning whether he was unaware of his feelings.

Although it could be considered presumptuous, Charlotte was extremely serious.

She was seriously asking if he liked her.

Helmut couldn’t find the words to say and remained silent for a moment before speaking.

“I have a girlfriend.”

“Really?”

“Yes, the girl I was with during the festival.”

“I’ve heard about that. Then I believe you.”

Helmut stared at Charlotte intently. Charlotte, having come to a clear conclusion, smiled brightly.

“That’s a relief. I won’t have to feel uncomfortable around you.”

This was her doctrine that such matters should be made clear.

Charlotte wanted to get along with Helmut, and she didn’t want to give false hope to him if he liked her.

Helmut might find it unpleasant, but Charlotte was the Duchess of Rinosa.

She had never even dreamed of a union with a commoner. For a high noble, there are suitable partners befitting a high noble.

Usually someone the family would at least not oppose.

And Helmut was clearly not that kind of person.

Just as Margret was faithfully the Duchess of Renosa, Charlotte had a similar inclination.

“You, why do you suspect such things so naturally?”

Helmut was a bit taken aback. He wasn’t feeling bad or unpleasant, but he had never seen anyone so confidently suspecting he liked them.

Helmut didn’t understand girls around this age well, but he thought it wasn’t a common occurrence.

“Well.”

Charlotte swallowed her words as if embarrassed.

She had received double-digit confessions since entering Greta Academy.

With her noble impression, easygoing and steady personality, she was liked by everyone, not just the instructors.

Even Asuka couldn’t treat Charlotte rudely.

Young men from good families who were confident showed interest in her.

Leon, who was brutally defeated by Helmut, was one of them.

But each time, Charlotte firmly declined, saying she wanted to focus on her studies.

Her refusals were consistent and straightforward, so they didn’t cause any resentment.

So it was natural for Charlotte to suspect that someone who was particularly kind to her might like her.

“The awards ceremony will start soon. I heard the prize money is substantial. There will probably be more special privileges.”

“Special privileges?”

Charlotte stared at him intently. And after a moment, she said.

“The privilege of meeting the people of the Grand Duchy of Rinosa.”

The Grand Duchy family of Rinosa is comparable to the imperial family of the Empire. They are people that only the noblest of nobles can meet.

However, Helmut now had the right to approach them.

Helmut didn’t ask how she knew that.

Charlotte is the Duchess of Rinosa. Helmut knew this fact, and Charlotte vaguely sensed that Helmut knew it.

Charlotte gave him advice.

“You might meet some difficult people. Be careful not to clash with them.”

Helmut silently nodded. He seemed to understand what she was saying.

‘Michael.’

He would meet him soon. Michael’s observational skills were exceptionally good.

People reveal their characteristics in many aspects.

Posture, attitude, atmosphere. Beyond appearance, all of that proves their identity.

Moreover, Helmut wasn’t very talented at acting.

Hyde was just Helmut with a changed appearance, and thus, Hyde was Helmut.

Whether Michael could discern this would only be known when they meet.



H.F.C Chapter 237 (Part 1):
				“Helmut, I knew you could do it!”

“Well done, Helmut!”

“Charlotte, great job too.”

“I’m proud of you both. You are the pride of Greta Academy!”

As soon as they stepped off the stage, words of congratulations poured in.

The faculty members of Greta Academy, who had stayed until the end, rushed over.

They’ll be free to go once Leon’s results come out tomorrow.

Before that, the Swordsmanship Department had achieved an almost perfect outcome. Only Nils, who was eliminated early, might not be so pleased.

Instructor Alan asked.

“So, Helmut. How do you feel?”

“How I feel… Well…”

Helmut was incredibly calm.

Even if he had won the final match of Basor’s martial arts tournament on the spot, his reaction would have been the same.

“What a boring guy. The award ceremony is about to start.”

Instructor Patricia patted his shoulder as she walked past. Amidst the surrounding commotion, Helmut thought calmly.

‘So it has come to this.’

He had won. Now everything was about to begin. Charlotte’s face was bright with happiness.

She seemed to have relaxed after the tournament ended.

They were in Ratona, Renosa, her hometown.

Although the semester had ended, Charlotte was already in Renosa, so she could start her vacation without any time loss.

From today, Charlotte would return to her place as the Duchess of Renosa.

When the vacation ends, she’ll return to Greta Academy as the top first-year student in the Swordsmanship Department.

Soon, an attendant came running and shouted.

“The award ceremony will now proceed. The two of you, please come up to the stage!”

Amidst the applause from the faculty, Helmut stepped forward with Charlotte.

Winner Helmut, and runner-up Charlotte.

The awards will be presented on stage. And the one presenting might be…

A tension like before a battle rose up.

It was a strange, gut-wrenching feeling, not just the usual pre-fight nerves.

If it were merely the tension from an upcoming battle, he would be used to it. The heaviness of his steps felt unfamiliar to Helmut.

Charlotte’s face, following behind him, also seemed to stiffen.

One figure was already on stage. Behind him were knights dressed in black.

They were members of the Black Wing Knights. Helmut’s gaze turned to the figure on the stage.

Someone spoke to Helmut.

“It’s the Duke of Renosa.”

The sunlight was blinding.

There stood a small boy with blonde hair, dressed in white ceremonial clothes.

With an angelic face and features as pretty as a girl’s, the boy wore a gentle smile. Yet, Helmut knew how cold his personality was.

Although the boy had only shown kindness to Helmut.

He had hardly changed. Having shared a room with him, Michael’s appearance was familiar even after all this time.

‘No, maybe he was never unfamiliar from the start.’

Helmut wasn’t pleased with the situation where his brother might become an enemy.

Michael’s eyes narrowed. He strode up and stood before Helmut. His eyes curved softly.

“Haven’t we met somewhere before?”

“I’m not sure.”

The indifferent response stuck in Michael’s ear. His eyes showed a spark of interest.

He stared at Helmut intensely, as if he could see through to the flesh beneath his skin.

“But why do you seem so familiar to me?”

Helmut didn’t answer. Michael took another step closer. The look in his eyes was familiar.

Cold and indifferent. Though the color was different, the essence of the gaze was clear.

Magic had changed Helmut’s appearance, but not his skeletal structure.

If you made slight changes to Helmut’s face, you’d get a person Michael could perfectly recall.

However, this confused Michael.

Because the Hyde Michael knew was neither a commoner nor someone he thought would have Renosa blood.

And he didn’t expect him to appear this way.

Changing the impression of an ally he had held oddly favorable feelings for wasn’t easy for anyone. Not even for Michael.

But Michael soon steadied himself and smiled coolly. His low whisper reached Helmut.

“This is unexpected. I was looking for you, and here you are right in front of me.”

Without another word, he turned away from Helmut.

As if there was no need to confirm anything further. As if he was certain Helmut was Hyde. It was a confidence in his own judgment.

Michael glided over to stand before Charlotte.

Charlotte gazed at Michael with a tense face.

If he were to announce here that she was the Duchess of Renosa…

But Michael didn’t act according to her fears.

“Congratulations on your second place, Charlotte.”

Michael’s voice was polite. It was different from the soft way he used to call her Charlotte.

He seemed determined to keep his promise.

Charlotte nodded.

“Thank you.”

Without saying anything more, Michael stepped back with a strangely cold demeanor.

His gaze took in both Charlotte and Helmut. The two had met at Greta Academy.

Could this really be a coincidence? Might Charlotte know something?

The feeling that something unknown was happening troubled Michael, furrowing his brow.

It was a feeling unpleasant to someone who wanted to grasp everything within his control.

“The Grand Duchess of Renosa will now present the awards to the winner and the runner-up!”

An attendant loudly announced once more.

Originally, it would have been Michael presenting the awards, but the Grand Duchess of Renosa was present.

So it wasn’t strange for her to conduct the ceremony.

Before the match ended, she had already asked for Michael’s consent.

Because she had to confirm up close.



H.F.C Chapter 237 (Part 2):
				An elegant blonde lady ascended the stage. Maidservants and knights followed her closely.

As Margret came up on stage, cheers erupted from the audience.

She was gentle and dignified, truly befitting the wife of a leader ruling a country.

Margret took the medal and approached Helmut.

Very close, close enough for only him to hear her whisper.

The reflection of light from her hand came from a winner’s medal bearing both the symbol of the Comprehensive Swordsmanship Tournament and Rinosa’s Black Wing.

But Helmut felt no emotion toward it.

Yet, the moment was overwhelming.

Her gaze was calm as she looked at him.

Helmut felt it. His memories were being drawn up, existing right before his eyes.

The sensation was like a dead life resurrecting and taking flight.

This is what it feels like when something you’ve risked your life pursuing comes to fruition.

For the first time, Helmut realized it.

She could hang the medal on the winner and offer words of encouragement.

Margret opened her mouth.

“Helmut.”

Her voice was soft and low. It hadn’t changed much from the voice in Helmut’s memory.

Helmut pieced together the fragments of his memory. Margret’s presence made it possible.

“Yes.”

“Your name doesn’t feel unfamiliar to me.”

Margret slowly hung the medal around his neck. It was an elegant movement without a hint of agitation.

Not a single fingertip touched him.

But her gaze wavered.

As if torn between wanting to speak and knowing she shouldn’t.

“You remind me of someone I know.”

“Who is that?”

Helmut asked. He too was torn between wanting to speak and knowing he shouldn’t.

He wanted to pull out the pendant from his chest right then and ask if she knew what it was.

To ask if she knew who he was.

He wanted to tell her that he had lived, grown up, and returned from the Forest of Pahe.

It was a desire he felt for the first time since meeting Darien in the Forest of Roots.

But all those words burned hotly in his throat like a fireball.

Margret tilted her head and answered quietly.

“Someone who’s already been forgotten. I buried that person too. But…”

Margret frowned.

“Strangely enough, seeing you reminds me of that person. As if the dead have come back to life from the grave.”

If anyone else listened, they might suspect a past lover of the Grand Duchess of Rinosa. But Helmut’s striking resemblance to the Grand Duke dispelled such suspicions.

Margret spoke again.

“You’re the top second-year student at Greta Academy, right?”

“Yes, I’m close with Charlotte.”

Helmut spoke as if he knew Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Margret smiled with wistful eyes.

“Are you staying in Ratona?”

“I’d like to for a while.”

The conversation felt almost coordinated. As if a secret pact was made.

“Then it would be good to change your lodgings. As a special privilege for the winner, I’ll arrange for you to stay at the palace. You can have meals with Charlotte since you’re her senior.”

“That would be an honor.”

Helmut spoke formally, masking his rising emotions.

Margret whispered kindly.

“I saw your excellent skills. Thank you also for not hurting Charlotte. As the Grand Duchess, I promise to treat Helmut as an honored guest, as the winner of the comprehensive swordsmanship tournament.”

“Thank you.”

Having said what she wanted, Margret turned away from him. Applause erupted.

Helmut watched intently as she placed a medal around Charlotte’s neck.

Unlike Michael, who was certain Helmut was Hyde, Margret wasn’t sure if Helmut was her child.

But that intuition would drive her.

He caught snippets of conversation.

“Charlotte, you were amazing. I’m so proud of you. To come this far as just a first-year student.”

“Now I can return to the palace, right?.”

“Yes, let’s go back and rest. Greet your companions first.”

“Ah, what did you and Helmut talk about?”

“He said he’d stay in Ratona, so I offered him a place in the palace. I will treat him as an honored guest.”

“Oh, I see.”

Charlotte glanced skeptically at Helmut.

There was still an unresolved question.

How did Helmut know the name Margret Irene?

But even Charlotte didn’t know if that was an important issue.

Today, at the end of the tournament, was a day to celebrate.

‘If senior is staying in the palace, I’ll ask him slowly.’

Charlotte turned her gaze away from him.



H.F.C Chapter 238 (Part 1):
				The next day, the senior swordsmanship tournament finals took place.

It was a match involving Leon, the fourth-year representative from Greta Academy.

After a grueling hour-long battle, Leon, drenched in sweat, managed to secure the victory.

With this, Greta Academy had produced two champions and one runner-up.

Only Nils, who had been eliminated early, felt a bit bitter.

However, his bitterness wasn’t as great as that of the other students from Baden academies.

Especially the arrogant students from Matesis Academy, who couldn’t even lift their heads due to the unexpected result from Greta Academy, which they had looked down upon.

The only piece of good news for all Baden academies was the outstanding performance of their students, who had been excluded by the temple.

All the top-ranking participants were from Baden.

The instructors were in a celebratory mood.

“Congratulations to all of you!”

“We’re proud of you.”

Even the usually stern Instructor Patricia and the strict Instructor Alan were beaming today.

Had Ethan Kudrow been present, his reaction wouldn’t have been different.

Leon, despite winning the highly esteemed senior swordsmanship tournament, remained humble.

Somehow, he kept his distance and sat far away from Helmut.

As everyone from Greta Academy acknowledged, Helmut was superior to Leon. Leon, even with his newfound confidence, hadn’t forgotten this fact.

For the remaining members of Greta Academy, the staff at the lodging prepared a lavish banquet.

Although the tournament had ended, they didn’t need to leave the lodging immediately, but they would have to vacate it soon.

Everyone would return to their respective places.

The academy instructors didn’t comment much on Helmut’s decision.

The Ratona Palace was too grand a place for a commoner like Helmut, but he was the tournament champion.

As long as it wasn’t a threat to the student’s safety, the faculty had no say in where he stayed during the vacation.

However, they were curious about Helmut’s decision.

“I heard you decided to stay in Rinosa. Does Instructor Ethan know about this?”

“I plan to write him a letter.”

“Do you like it here?”

“Yes.”

His short answer left them guessing. Instructor Alan nodded.

“Well, if the Duchess of Renosa has promised good treatment, staying here during the vacation isn’t a bad idea. Ratona’s scenery is beautiful.”

“Though, I wonder if you can avoid being recruited by the Black Wing Knights.”

“The Black Wing Knights would surely covet someone like Helmut.”

Charlotte, sitting next to him, glanced around slightly. Helmut casually cut her off.

“We’ll see.”

Becoming a member of the Black Wing Knights to stay close to his mother was something he had considered.

Being a guest as the tournament champion was temporary.

For Helmut to stay in Renosa long-term, he needed a valid reason. A reason to leave Greta Academy and remain here.

But was there meaning in staying around like that?

His mother wasn’t in danger, and there was no need for Helmut to protect her.

If his mother didn’t need him, should he still stay here?

Wouldn’t his presence be more of a burden?

Helmut calmed down. He had found his mother and confirmed she was living safely and peacefully.

And he had revealed his existence to her.

Perhaps that was enough. His purpose might have been fulfilled with that.

If any further wishes would cause harm, he should stop. Helmut accepted this fact calmly.

“With the semester over, you’ll soon be a third-year student.”

Professor Luxen muttered, stroking his chin. The instructors exchanged smiles.

They continued their conversation as if nothing had happened.

Helmut silently lifted the glass of water in front of him.

He was facing a turning point.

However, returning to the academy didn’t seem to be an option at this juncture.

Changes were bound to occur.



H.F.C Chapter 238 (Part 2):
				The very next day, the Greta Academy group dispersed.

The swordsmanship tournament had ended, and with the vacation upon them, everyone went their separate ways.

Only the faculty had left. The three remaining students had no intention of leaving Renosa immediately.

Helmut stayed at the lodging, and surprisingly, so did Leon.

Charlotte staying was simply a given.

That afternoon, a carriage arrived from the palace along with some people.

As promised by the Duchess of Renosa, Helmut was to move to a new residence.

But unexpectedly, Leon accompanied him.

“We’re here to escort you to the palace. All three of you.”

Leon followed along willingly, as if he had received some kind of assurance.

Helmut realized belatedly that Leon was also a tournament champion.

In other words, a talent that the Black Wing Knights would covet. If they were giving Helmut a place to stay, it would be natural to do the same for Leon.

In fact, as a senior and soon-to-be graduate, Leon would likely receive even more generous treatment. To maintain appearances.

Margret, the Duchess of Renosa, managed it perfectly.

She maintained a perfect distance and carried out the procedures.

As he had felt when they met before, if Helmut hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed that his mother had been moved upon seeing him.

She was very composed.

In a way, she neither showed special affection nor animosity towards Helmut, who might be suspected as the Duke of Renosa’s illegitimate child, and treated Helmut and Leon with the same fair treatment as the tournament champions they were.

Upon stepping out of the carriage, Charlotte, guided by someone, slipped away quietly. Helmut and Leon bowed their heads in unison upon meeting the Duchess of Renosa.

“We are honored to meet you, Your Grace the Duchess.”

“Welcome to our Renosa palace.”

The elegant and graceful Duchess smiled kindly. A smile that made the young boys feel insignificant.

Even the usually arrogant Leon couldn’t bring himself to look up at her.

“Please enjoy your stay. Since it’s vacation, rest as much as you like and leave at your convenience. Latona’s scenery is beautiful, so feel free to go out and enjoy it. As champions, you deserve to enjoy this.”

“It’s an honor, Your Grace.”

Leon was the first to respond promptly. He was from a noble background. Helmut thought Leon was useful in this situation.

Helmut didn’t know what to say. He just replied briefly.

“Yes.”

Her gaze lingered on Helmut for a fleeting moment. Eyes as blue as a lake, filled with an indecipherable emotion.

However, Margret, who had looked at Helmut briefly, immediately turned her attention to Leon.

“I’ve heard that my son Michael is very interested in you. He said you had a conversation right after the award ceremony.”

“Yes, His Highness showed great interest in my swordsmanship.”

“Michael must have been deeply impressed by your skills. I hope you can get along well, even if it’s a bit inconvenient.”

“Inconvenient? Not at all, Your Grace!”

Leon immediately lifted his head. He already seemed half-enchanted by Michael.

Michael had a knack for winning people over. Especially someone like Leon, who had lived somewhat isolated due to Helmut’s overshadowing presence.

Michael was not only impressed by Leon’s skills but also intended to gather information about Helmut through him.

Because even if Michael was certain in his heart, he was the type of person who needed evidence for his certainty.

That’s what Helmut thought. He wasn’t particularly skilled at understanding people, but he could read Michael’s intentions clearly.

It wasn’t knowledge-based understanding; it was perhaps an understanding born from blood.

“Michael is indeed a brilliant and intelligent person, fitting for the heir of Renosa. If he had joined the academy, we would have formed a deep friendship.”

“Oh, I’m glad you think so highly of Michael.”

Margret responded with a soft laugh. Leon passionately praised Michael, the future lord.

He already acted as if he had become a member of the Black Wing Knights.

In that short moment, he seemed to have decided his path completely. Watching them, Helmut calmly collected his thoughts.

‘The Black Wing Knights are indeed desirable for top students from the academy.’

Even without ulterior motives, Leon’s skills alone would make Michael want to recruit him.

Although he had lost to Helmut in a single strike, Leon was still a recognized talent outside.

Michael had a strong desire for talent.

It was strange that he hadn’t tried to recruit Helmut, the champion, yet.

Or perhaps it wasn’t strange. Michael was convinced that Helmut was Hyde.

‘Michael… I will have to face him eventually.’

Since the award ceremony a few days ago, Michael hadn’t approached Helmut personally.

Normally, Michael would have gathered enough information about Helmut with just a few conversations, but he decided to hold back for now.

Helmut didn’t think Michael had lost interest in him. Michael was persistent.

He wouldn’t just rely on Leon to gather information about Helmut.

And Helmut’s guess was precisely correct.

*

Returning to her room and changing her clothes, Charlotte stretched her back.

She felt comfortable, as if she had found her place.

No matter how high her status, Charlotte had lived her entire life as the Duchess of Renosa.

She was more familiar with being the Duchess of Renosa than Charlotte from Greta Academy.

Now, she wasn’t even the runner-up Charlotte; she was the Duchess of Renosa during the vacation.

She didn’t intend to hide it from Leon either.

Just as she was about to leave the room, someone’s voice came down upon her.

“Charlotte, what do you know about that person called Helmut?”



H.F.C Chapter 239 (Part 1):
				It seemed he had been waiting. Charlotte silently turned to look at Michael, who was staring at her with his arms crossed.

His face wore a smile different from usual. A cold smile closer to his true nature.

“Charlotte.”

His tone was coaxing. Soft yet subtly coercive.

“You’re close to him.”

Charlotte frowned. Helmut was an outstanding swordsman.

It would be more strange if Michael, who loves talented individuals, didn’t covet him.

However, Michael’s words seemed to imply something beyond that.

‘Michael must also be suspecting that Senior Helmut might be of our family’s bloodline.’

If Helmut were the Grand Duke’s illegitimate child, he could potentially threaten even Michael’s position.

Michael would never tolerate such a situation.

But Charlotte didn’t clumsily defend Helmut. She had no intention of telling Michael what she knew.

“We became close while coming to Rinosa, but I’m not that close to Senior. As you know, we can’t reveal our identities at the Academy.

Senior only recently found out that I’m from Rinosa. I don’t know what you’re curious about, but I don’t know much about Senior Helmut. I probably don’t know more than you do.”

Charlotte guessed that Michael must have done some background research. There probably wasn’t much information available about Helmut.

Michael didn’t take his eyes off Charlotte for even a moment. His gaze was observant.

“You’ve known him since the first semester. Do you know what your Senior Helmut did during the vacation? Where he went, for instance?”

“No, we never talked about such things. I told you. I’m not that close to Senior Helmut.”

Charlotte firmly denied it. Her words were true. But Michael didn’t stop.

“Then when you saw him after the vacation, was there anything different about him?”

“Well, something different…”

Charlotte, about to answer without much thought, suddenly flinched.

Helmut had changed after the vacation. It was such a noticeable change that many people talked about it.

Charlotte wasn’t sure if she should mention it. There was something that felt off.

‘During the vacation, Senior Helmut’s skin had tanned, which became a topic of conversation. There were rumors that he might have gone to train in a hot region.’

Helmut is a famous figure in the Swordsmanship Department. Even trivial rumors about him reached Charlotte’s ears. Her thoughts naturally connected.

‘A hot region, Michael went to Basore. Then perhaps…’

Could they have met? Charlotte didn’t voice this suspicion.

But Michael sensed a slight agitation from her expression. He spoke in his characteristic gentle tone.

“Charlotte, answer me.”

Charlotte, lowering her gaze, blurted out.

“…I don’t remember anything.”

“You, you’re hiding something from me.”

Michael smiled. It was a smile that felt chilling. As if directed at his enemy.

To Michael, Charlotte was a being that easily crossed the line between family and enemy.

Especially when Charlotte tried to hide something from him, he became more hostile.

“If you can’t say it, I’ll tell you what I know. During the vacation when you came to Rinosa, I went to watch the martial arts tournament in Basore. And there, I met someone with extraordinary skills.”

Charlotte’s gaze returned to Michael.

One way to draw words out of someone is to speak your own. By doing so, he could elicit a reaction from the other person. That reaction sometimes becomes the answer.

Michael continued speaking smoothly with a bitten smile.

“His name was Hyde, age sixteen. That’s what he claimed. I didn’t think it was the truth. I wanted him. I wanted him so badly.

To the extent that I’ve never wanted someone so much in my life. Because he was truly strong. I knew it.”

“So what are you saying about this Hyde person?”

Charlotte asked, feeling a vague sense of unease.

“His skills were truly remarkable. Enough to defeat countless strong opponents and Palma Knights to reach the finals.

Although the final match couldn’t be held due to some incident, I consider him the winner. The Basore martial arts tournament is incomparable to this mere Academy swordsmanship tournament. The skill level of the participants is incomparably different.

If Hyde were an Academy student and had participated in this swordsmanship tournament, he would undoubtedly have won.”

Michael smiled and said clearly.

“I think Helmut is that Hyde guy. Even though his appearance, swordsmanship, and the sword he holds don’t match.”

Charlotte’s eyes widened.

“As you know, my eyesight is quite good.”

“Isn’t that just groundless suspicion? No matter how skilled Senior Helmut is, it’s hard to believe that a mere Academy student won the Basore martial arts tournament.”

“You’ve seen it too. Your senior’s skills.”

Charlotte couldn’t deny that. Inwardly, she thought that if it were Senior Helmut, it might be possible.

In Charlotte’s eyes, Helmut had no reason to attend the academy. Even the instructors didn’t try to teach him anything.

But then why was Helmut at Greta Academy? It was a puzzling question.



H.F.C Chapter 239 (Part 2):
				To the confused Charlotte, Michael asked casually.

“Did your senior always use that sword? The one he’s using now, I mean.”

Suddenly, a memory flashed through Charlotte’s mind.

Helmut’s sword had changed abruptly. Helmut had told Charlotte that he had to repair it, so he got a new one.

But for a sword that needed repairing, it was a gleaming masterpiece.

She hadn’t thought much of it at the time, but it did feel strange now.

“Well, I rarely had the chance to see Senior’s sword since we practiced with wooden swords. I don’t know about originally, but when we sparred with real swords, Senior used that sword.”

Charlotte intentionally omitted the truth that he had used the current sword when sparring with her after coming to Ratona, and evaded the question.

She had no particular reason to protect Helmut and hide the truth from Michael.

However, even without a reason, Charlotte instinctively did so.

Even though she herself harbored suspicions about Helmut regarding the name ‘Margret Irene’.

It was unlike the Grand Duchess of Rinosa.

“His sword looked new. The handle and scabbard all seemed to have been made recently. As if he had recently purchased a sword to avoid being recognized.”

That also struck a chord. But Charlotte responded with silence.

Michael calmly dropped a shocking statement.

“Hyde had the sword of Darien, the missing Sword Saint of Basore.”

Charlotte reflexively questioned.

“What?”

“Judging by his exceptional swordsmanship, Hyde was likely Darien’s disciple. But if so, why did Hyde quietly leave Basore? Without revealing his identity.

He could have held wealth and power in Basore. Instead of continuing meaningless studies at the Academy.”

Michael’s smile deepened.

“This is what I think. He had a purpose for coming to Basore, and he left after achieving that purpose. What could that purpose have been?

One thing is certain. After he appeared in Basore, the Palma Knights’ commander died.

There’s an official statement about his death, but everything is suspicious. And in Basore, the Sword Saint’s grandson appeared. What does this sequence of events mean? Doesn’t it seem to point to something?”

Michael pointed out sharply.

“The former Palma Knights’ commander, Lutus Cicero, betrayed the Sword Saint, and his disciple appeared to take revenge for him. That’s why he didn’t reveal his identity.”

“That seems like too much speculation.”

“Even if it’s a conjecture with weak evidence, it’s not just speculation. As you know, I rarely get things wrong.”

“Even so…”

Charlotte wavered. She could feel her own agitation showing on her face.

“I’d like you to be curious too. As a member of the Grand Duke’s family. Why that suspiciously skilled senior went to Basore, and why he decided to stay in our Rinosa.”

“Isn’t Senior Helmut staying in Rinosa because of Mother’s recommendation?”

By now, Charlotte was agreeing with Michael’s assertion that Hyde was Helmut.

She too, inwardly thought that Michael wasn’t wrong.

It was natural. Helmut’s skills were truly astonishing.

If it were him, it wouldn’t be strange for him to win the Basore martial arts tournament, and it wouldn’t be strange if he were the Sword Saint’s disciple.

In fact, Helmut had changed his sword. He’s a senior with many suspicious and secretive aspects. The suspicions Michael raised were fascinating.

However, Charlotte’s inclination towards Michael’s words was not merely due to his eloquence.

Michael calmly continued.

“He is someone who moves according to his purpose. His staying in Renosa isn’t just for such a reason. Doesn’t he look like he has Renosa’s bloodline to you?”

As if some kind of conspiracy was lurking.

“Stop it.”

In confusion, Charlotte ended the conversation. She saw the maids approaching from the other side. It wasn’t something to talk about in front of others.

Charlotte spoke as clearly as Michael had.

“You’re free to suspect whatever you want, but I’d prefer if you didn’t drag me into it. Michael.”

“Alright, if that’s your wish.”

Michael wrapped it up neatly. However, his eyes were still scanning Charlotte’s face observantly.

The heirs of Rinosa, Michael and Charlotte, moved side by side. It naturally became so as their paths were the same.

A picture-perfect banquet was welcoming the guests. The Grand Duchess of Rinosa, Helmut, and Leon were already present.

Charlotte and Michael entered the banquet hall as if nothing had happened.

The banquet where the Grand Duchess of Rinosa and her two children entertained the guests continued in a harmonious atmosphere. While hiding secrets.

A storm was approaching. As if dark clouds were rolling in.

No one could know what would remain when the sky cleared.



H.F.C Chapter 240 (Part 1): Storm
				It was deep in the forest. It moved as if flying over the mountain range. Agile yet silent movements.

Like a wild beast, but not running on four legs. Bipedal.

It was running while holding a blood-stained sword in one hand.

If someone saw it, they would think of one word:

Monster.

Tattered clothes, a body stained black, eyes horribly bloodshot, cracked skin, swollen muscles.

Once, its demonic energy soared as if it would reach the sky, but now it hung down like wet clothes.

Yet, the murderous intent in its eyes was palpable.

An aggressive instinct to kill, devour, and destroy. This being, full of wickedness, was once a human.

Yes, until just recently.

Before a certain change found him, he wasn’t even an ordinary person.

He wasn’t just any weak and feeble human.

A first-rank Platinum mercenary.

That was a prestigious position not attainable by just anyone.

Becoming a Platinum mercenary wasn’t a matter of effort. It was talent. Talent for Vis. Talent for the sword.

In terms of talent, he was exceptional. He had never seen anyone more talented with a sword than himself in his entire life.

From a very young age, he was different from others.

Although born a commoner, he was incredibly intelligent, quickly learning to read and amass knowledge with minimal guidance, and his physical movements were extraordinary.

He quickly realized that wielding a sword was more advantageous for him than studying.

For a commoner, martial prowess was the simplest means to elevate oneself.

But he was inherently violent and cruel.

Whether something within him made him that way, or if it was his natural temperament, he couldn’t tell.

But his violence and cruelty were beyond the control of reason, and he knew it.

That he was like an untamed beast.

At fifteen, when he ruled as the alley boss, he had a fight with a friend.

That fight stimulated something from within his heart.

Warm or gentle emotions didn’t touch him. Friendship had no effect on him. He had the dullest, coldest heart.

His cruel instinct, like that of a beast, didn’t stop at tearing apart the limbs of insects.

The hand that killed animals soon turned towards humans in anger.

After committing the act, looking down at the mutilated corpse and his blood-stained hands, he realized he could no longer live in this peaceful village.

His parents had long feared him, and so did the villagers.

Having committed murder, he knew he would be immediately identified as the culprit.

What if they did? He could just kill them all. It was an evil, tempting impulse.

But the thought he had immediately didn’t come to fruition in reality.

He was cruel, but not cruel enough to slaughter an entire village.

He was still human then. Reason and faint affection held him back.

But now he was a murderer. Leaving the village and changing his identity, he decided to become a mercenary.

Though an untrained swordsman, his talent alone was enough to make him a mercenary.

Other’s swords seemed laughably slow, and Vis quickly became part of him.

It wasn’t that he didn’t make an effort, and he enjoyed real combat.

As a mercenary, he learned swordsmanship by watching knights and other mercenaries, improving his skills.

It went smoothly. Knowing his own nature, he mainly took on jobs dealing with magical beasts rather than humans, and escort missions rather than guard duty.

At twenty-six, he reached the position of first-rank Platinum mercenary at a young age.

Since becoming a mercenary, he had encountered minor conflicts but lived a smooth life, proud that he had lived without any major problems.

Until that incident happened.

He was on a mission to hunt beasts, a type of mission he enjoyed.

During this time, he met the priests of Lumen for the first time in his life.

Were the priests the problem? Something about them stirred him deep within his heart.

It was a strange sensation. Although the priests were not hostile, there was an aura of threat from them.

As if they would annihilate his existence. Irrationally, it shook the vessel within him.

It was a vessel that had been slowly filling drop by drop since birth.

He was aware of the vessel within him that was about to burst.

He knew that when the last drop fell, the filled vessel would completely change him.

Knowing that all his talent, strength, and everything came from something lurking within him.

Though he didn’t know its name, he knew its existence.

Like he had made a pact with the demon lord said to have perished in ancient times, he knew that one day he would have to pay the price for having what ordinary humans did not.



H.F.C Chapter 240 (Part 2): Storm
				The Lumen priests were simply what triggered that final drop.

He didn’t know what they did. It could have been a trivial stimulus.

Just like when he killed his friend in childhood.

Reason flew away, and only pitch-black murderous intent engulfed him.

The explosion was intense. Someone might have shouted the term “Seed of Darkness.”

Reason disappeared, leaving only a monster driven by instinct. He killed three priests and five holy knights, leaving the scorched place behind.

Just as he had left the village where he lived with his parents, he didn’t have the reason to find a new home.

Reason is something that exists in humans.

He only had instinct left. The instinct to destroy everything!

He would follow that evil instinct. That was the price for having transcendent power.

It was also the end of a human dominated by the fully grown Seed of Darkness.

**

Helmut’s life was peaceful. It felt like living in an expanded version of the Kudrow mansion.

Comfortable and luxurious living. If he hadn’t been born with the Seed of Darkness, these were things he should have naturally enjoyed in Ratona from childhood.

He had lived almost all his life in the forest, nearly as a commoner, yet strangely, the luxury suited Helmut well.

Helmut didn’t think it was because noble blood ran through his veins.

‘It’s probably because I adapt well.’

He knew that he was under scrutiny.

Helmut resembled the Grand Duke of Renosa. He heard the maids gossiping and he too was curious.

How much did he resemble the Grand Duke of Renosa? Would he feel a connection if he saw him?

‘Father, huh…’

At the moment of Helmut’s birth, the Grand Duke of Renosa was not present. The existence of a father was faint to him. He had never seen him even once.

Before Helmut knew that his mother was the Grand Duchess of Renosa, he even considered the possibility that she might have been a single mother or a widow.

But now he thought he understood why the Grand Duke didn’t appear at his birth.

His father was a Grand Duke, and thus too busy to even look back at the birth of his child.

Above all, the Grand Duke of Rinosa tended to be cold towards his family.

The only person he showed some affection for was the beautiful and virtuous Duchess, but even she did not take precedence over ruling Renosa.

‘Will I get to see my father before the vacation ends?’

He had a premonition that he might not return to the academy, but that premonition might be wrong.

With Ethan Kudrow and Alea at Greta Academy, Helmut always had a place to return to.

The Grand Duke of Renosa had left Ratona. That was the only news Helmut knew.

Even if he returned, there was no guarantee he would meet Helmut.

Helmut would stay in Renosa until the end of the vacation.

After that, there was no reason for him to stay.

Charlotte, the only person he knew, would leave for Baden.

Renosa would also send him away, telling him to return with her.

He couldn’t stay here indefinitely, treated as a distinguished guest.

So, something had to be settled before then.

‘But how?’

He couldn’t just abruptly show his mother the pendant.

Michael was wary of Helmut, only seeking Leon but sensing he was being watched.

From Helmut’s perspective, there was no way to personally approach the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

She had to come to him.

‘Will Mother really…’

Helmut decided to stay quiet until the attention on him waned, and until the maids got used to and stopped gossiping about the handsome boy who looked exactly like the Grand Duke.

That wasn’t difficult.

Helmut was treated as a distinguished guest. A spacious and luxurious room, a personal training ground, occasionally invited to banquets.

The past four days he spent in the Ratona Palace were very comfortable. Charlotte, who revealed that she was the Duchess of Renosa, didn’t seek him, often showing a complicated expression.

As if avoiding him.

Though Helmut was indifferent, he sensed something between her and Michael.

But it wasn’t Helmut’s concern. Alea had said she wouldn’t be in contact for a while as she had things to do.

Right now, the most important thing for Helmut was his mother.

‘Should I walk around the palace a bit?’

As the Grand Duchess of Renosa, it wouldn’t be easy for her to find an excuse to approach Helmut.

But she had told him, in a meaningful voice, that he could freely explore the palace.

Wasn’t that asking him to create an opportunity?

Helmut started moving. Guided by a maid, he soon reached a certain corridor.

A hallway lined with portraits of the Grand Duke’s family members.

Shortly after he stood there, light footsteps echoed through the corridor.

It was a presence he could recognize even with his eyes closed now.

Helmut waited until the owner of those footsteps got completely close.

An elegant and gentle voice reached his ears.

“Helmut, you were here.”

Helmut quietly turned to the side.

And he bowed his head towards the beautiful noblewoman standing there.

“Your Grace, the Grand Duchess.”



H.F.C Chapter 241 (Part 1):
				“How is life in the palace?”

“It’s…comfortable.”

The Grand Duchess was alone. Judging by the presence she sensed nearby, it seemed she had sent the attendants away.

It was a sign that she wanted to have a conversation.

She smiled faintly.

“I’m glad to see you’re adjusting well. I heard you were a commoner.”

It wasn’t a sarcastic comment about how well a commoner was adapting.

Even Michael didn’t speak to Helmut in that manner.

“I have lived in a noble’s mansion before. I had a noble guardian. Thanks to that patronage, I was able to enter the academy.”

“I heard you transferred to Greta Academy. How do you know this noble guardian?”

“He is an acquaintance of my master.”

Michael hadn’t told the Grand Duchess about his suspicion that Sword Saint Darien might be Helmut’s master.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa never rushed to interrogate. She led the conversation naturally.

Helmut knew that her caution was part of her nature.

She was someone who would never allow her foundation to be shaken.

She had been raised as a noble and lived as one.

The Grand Duchess spoke softly.

“How did you live before coming to the academy?”

“I lived in the forest. Just my master and I. Hunting and learning swordsmanship.”

The Grand Duchess’s gaze, which had been wandering, suddenly focused on Helmut. She asked slowly.

“What about your parents?”

“I was abandoned as a child and became an orphan.”

“I see…”

The two of them had, at some point, started walking side by side.

If there hadn’t been an age difference, it would not have been permissible for the Grand Duchess and Helmut to be alone together like this.

“Do you have any idea where you were born, or who your parents are?”

“I have a guess. But I think they must have had a reason to abandon me.”

“Have you… thought about finding them?”

“I don’t know if that’s what they would want.”

There’s a term called “force majeure.” Being born a commoner or a noble is more absolute than that.

Like Helmut, who was born with the Seed of Darkness and was abandoned because of it.

By leaving the Forest of Roots, Helmut made the impossible possible—he survived in a place where a person with the Seed of Darkness shouldn’t have.

But that was possible by his own will. Returning to his rightful place was another matter.

“I see. Don’t you miss them?”

“I do.”

Helmut replied briefly. Wasn’t it that longing that brought him here?

The Grand Duchess of Renosa closed her mouth. Their steps moved along the wall.

Portraits were lined up on the wall, as if narrating the history of the Grand Duchy of Renosa.

The power of the bloodline was strong. The resemblance was striking in the faces.

Then, Helmut suddenly noticed something and stopped.

“This place.”

There was an empty spot among the portraits. A place where a portrait should have been next to the current Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, beside a youthful portrait of Michael and Charlotte.

Helmut frowned.

“Why is this place empty?”

The Grand Duchess paused for a moment before answering.

“It’s a trace of someone we lost before we could paint their portrait.”

Helmut realized that it was his place.

It seemed like there were no traces of him left in Ratona.

It was as if the fact that a child named Helmut was born had been erased. If he didn’t have the pendant and his mother wasn’t here, Helmut might never have known this was his birthplace.

He was just someone buried in someone’s memory.

The Grand Duchess’s face trembled slightly as she looked at the empty space. She confessed, as if painfully forcing the words out.

“It was my first child, whom I had to let go due to an unfortunate accident.”

Helmut swallowed his words. He didn’t know what to say.

“I sometimes think about that child. It doesn’t hurt as much now that so much time has passed. If that child had grown up normally, how would he have turned out? Following the Renosa bloodline, he would have held a sword and probably become an excellent swordsman. He would have grown up splendidly as the heir to Renosa.”

The Grand Duchess continued with a subdued gaze.

“I was surprised when I saw you, Helmut. You resembled the child I had imagined growing up.”

A sharp pain pierced his heart. Or perhaps it was joy—he couldn’t tell.

Helmut looked at the Grand Duchess. She was also looking at him.

Her eyes held sadness.

And something else. Hope.



H.F.C Chapter 241 (Part 2):
				“Just as I didn’t send my child away by my own will, your parents probably didn’t send you away by their own will either.”

Commoners are different from nobles.

Unlike her, there are many parents who abandon their children out of necessity, whether it’s due to poverty or to protect their own lives, or because the child wasn’t supposed to be born.

But the Grand Duchess dismissed those possibilities. She spoke as if saying what she wanted to believe.

“That’s why I believe that if Helmut, who has grown up so wonderfully, were to return, they wouldn’t reject him.”

As if she would accept her first child if he returned.

Her words moved Helmut.

The wall that had been blocking him crumbled. Helmut spoke immediately.

“I’ve been told that I resemble the Grand Duke a lot. The same with the Grand Duchess.”

It was something that could be taken as disrespectful. How could a commoner dare to compare himself to the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Renosa?

But the Grand Duchess didn’t rebuke his rudeness. She nodded instead.

The peculiar atmosphere between them made it possible.

“Yes, Helmut looks like he belongs to the Renosa bloodline. Even to my eyes.”

“I… was born in Renosa. Probably here in Ratona.”

Helmut stared directly at the Grand Duchess. It was almost as if he were confessing to being the illegitimate child of the Grand Duke.

But the Grand Duchess realized that wasn’t what he meant.

Her blue eyes trembled. She asked quietly.

“Are your parents still here in Ratona?”

Helmut nodded calmly.

“Yes.”

“If you have any evidence or mark… I might be able to help you find them.”

For the first time, her voice wavered.

“I do have a mark. Something I had with me when I was abandoned.”

“What is it?”

But before Helmut could answer, someone’s voice interrupted their conversation from a distance.

“There you are, Mother.”

Both of them were startled.

Absorbed in their conversation, not even Helmut had noticed his approach.

It felt as if their secret meeting had been interrupted.

“Michael!”

“I heard you were heading this way.”

The blond boy with an angelic smile first directed his gaze to the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

As if deliberately ignoring Helmut’s presence.

He probably hadn’t heard their conversation.

There was a distance, and if he had come any closer, Helmut would have noticed him first.

“So, you were talking with Charlotte’s senior.”

“Yes, we were talking about Charlotte.”

The Grand Duchess smiled gently. It was a lie. Helmut realized she didn’t want Michael to know the content of their conversation.

Helmut felt the same.

“The Rinosa Grand Duchy’s portraits…”

Michael’s gaze lingered briefly on the empty space the Grand Duchess had been staring at. He wasn’t unaware of its existence.

“Oh my, it’s already this late. I have things to do. I must be going now.”

Seeing there was no further opportunity for conversation, the Grand Duchess expressed her intention to leave first.

“Feel free to look around. Michael, I’ll see you later.”

She calmly bid farewell to Helmut with a gaze and left.

Michael, the intruder, and Helmut were left alone.

Michael, who had been consciously ignoring Helmut, suddenly spoke.

“Helmut, are you doing well?”

“Yes.”

His short answer made Michael’s smile deepen.

“You’re not falling perhaps for my mother, are you? She’s still young and beautiful, after all.”

“It’s not like that.”

Helmut was especially careful when talking to Michael. He feared he might slip into casual speech, as he had done when dealing with him as Hyde.

“Then why do you seem to show emotions in front of her?”

“You must be mistaken.”

Helmut firmly denied it. He had become quite accustomed to lying now.

Michael laughed out loud unconsciously. But his expression soon turned cold.

“In that case, you should be careful. With the Grand Duke away, you could cause unnecessary misunderstandings.”

“It was Her Grace the Grand Duchess who sought me out.”

Helmut succinctly pointed out the fact.

After all, he had met many nobles at Greta Academy and hadn’t bowed to any of them.

It was the same outside the academy.

Especially if his opponent was his brother Michael, it was even less likely to happen.

No matter how much Michael was the Grand Duke’s heir and wary of him.

“That tone, it’s really arrogant. It’s very much like you. I liked that about you, but.”

Michael’s expression became strange.

He liked it. But not anymore.

It seemed like a denial should follow. But strangely, he couldn’t utter those words.

While his mind had defined Helmut as an enemy, his heart strangely couldn’t treat Helmut as one.

That discrepancy was peculiar.

It was a phenomenon Michael had never experienced before.



H.F.C Chapter 242 (Part 1):
				‘Are you really my brother?’

From the moment they first met, Michael was drawn to Hyde.

It wasn’t because he felt Hyde was strong, but rather, there was an inexplicable urge to keep him close.

It was a similar obsession to what he felt towards Charlotte.

Michael knew his desires well. No one was more faithful to his desires than himself.

Had it not been for the desire to achieve something despite being tormented by illness and close to death, he wouldn’t have survived such relentless suffering.

Michael realized that he still wanted to keep Hyde, or rather, Helmut, under his control.

It was a desire that was hard to ignore.

Whether it was due to a blood connection or not didn’t matter. It made him think differently.

‘Yes, after all, a bastard or a collateral branch can’t threaten my position.’

Even if the Grand Duke of Renosa favored Helmut, he was not the type to betray his wife and disrupt the bloodline.

Regardless of skills or talents, only the legitimate children could become the heirs of Renosa.

That was a principle that had been upheld for generations, and the Grand Duke of Renosa was not one to make choices that went against that principle.

‘Whatever his plans are, I’ll make it go my way. Taming a wild horse is never easy.’

Michael had faithfully played his role as the heir.

Even though he couldn’t wield a sword, even the discerning Grand Duke couldn’t deny that he was the most suitable to become the Grand Duke of Renosa.

Despite feeling a sense of unease in this portrait-lined room, Michael brushed off the feeling.

“Are you done talking?”

Helmut replied indifferently. Michael was a peculiar presence to Helmut as well.

He felt the urge to knock him down for being so arrogant but didn’t want to kill him.

Helmut was the type who found it hard to tolerate weaklings rising up, being accustomed to the law of the jungle.

And the Michael before him was pathetically weak.

Whether he had escorts or not, he could kill him with a flick of his finger. No one could stop him.

But strangely, he didn’t want to. Even though Michael was a nuisance, he found himself responding to him bit by bit.

Maybe it was because he was used to dealing with people like Asuka and Sian.

‘My patience has indeed grown.’

Just as Darien had said, academy life had made Helmut more human.

It seemed Darien’s arrangements were right.

Even though Darien himself was a grumpy and violent old man, he had a keen eye.

Michael smiled brightly.

“I hope we can see each other often from now on.”

And he added,

“It will happen.”

Leaving behind that arrogant declaration, Michael left.

Helmut looked indifferently at the empty spot where the portrait had been and then moved.

*

Margret frowned.

‘Michael showing up.’

The moment she heard Michael’s voice, Margret was startled.

Michael was an overly perceptive child. He might have noticed something he shouldn’t have.

Margret was worried about that. It was a truth she hadn’t even revealed to the tight-lipped Charlotte.

Margret was a noble and the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Even though she loved her children, she couldn’t trust them fully and reveal everything.

Finishing the conversation with a calm smile, Margret returned to her room and fell into thought.

Her heart was beating rapidly.

‘He has the mark.’

A memory flashed through her mind.

Charlotte had told Margret that Helmut knew the name ‘Margret Irene.’

Suddenly, she remembered the pendant with her maiden name engraved on it.

Margret had placed it around her first child’s neck as a final gift when sending him away.

Hoping for blessings on his journey.

But that child had been sent to the Forest of Roots, and the pendant made for him had gone to a place from which it would never return.

That was the predetermined conclusion.

‘No, that’s impossible. Such a thing has never happened in history. It’s impossible.’

Margret murmured to herself. But doubt and suspicion filled her as she denied it.

What if there was a mistake? What if the temple misidentified him? What if their sacred magic was flawed and sent him elsewhere?

What if he had survived by sheer luck?

Helmut possessed exceptional talent.

A child born with the seed of darkness, although displaying great talent in childhood, would develop a cruel nature.

And ultimately, they go out of control and become monsters.

But Helmut seemed sane. Rather, he appeared very composed and calm.

He hadn’t harmed his sister in the slightest.

He didn’t show any murderous intent towards other competitors but decided his matches calmly.

Helmut didn’t trample others to showcase his strength.

Pacing around the room, Margret lifted her head. Her blue eyes gleamed with determination.

‘I need to meet him again.’

The more she met him, the clearer it became, and the more she wavered.

Despite thinking it was impossible, and wondering if the suspicious boy was playing tricks, no thought overrode her instinctive pull.

As Margret, not the Grand Duchess of Renosa, she decided not to hesitate any longer.



H.F.C Chapter 242 (Part 2):
				It was late at night. Helmut was swinging his sword.

He never neglected his training, knowing that everything depended on his own strength.

The thought of becoming stronger hadn’t diminished even after coming to the land of his birth.

As long as the temple existed, he had to be a sharpened sword, but even if the temple didn’t exist, Helmut would live as he always had.

To become stronger. He was a swordsman, and the sword was his life. Letting go of it would never happen.

Recently, Helmut had been training with a real sword instead of a wooden one.

He had become comfortable handling the sword he bought in Ratona.

Though it wasn’t as good as Darien’s sword, he liked it quite a bit. This disguise too.

‘I wonder if Michael has noticed something.’

It bothers him that Michael suddenly changed his attitude.

Although Michael seemed to say he would bother him, it wasn’t something that would happen immediately.

The personal training ground was quiet. It was connected only by a staircase and room, with no other entrances.

The door leading outside was locked. Renosa favored swordsmen.

That’s why they specially prepared quarters with these private training grounds for swordsmen.

‘Should I head in now?’

He felt uneasy. Even though he tried to focus consciously, it seemed there wouldn’t be much progress.

Recently, even Alea had declared silence, leaving him with little to do.

However, just as he was about to move, he sensed a presence outside the door.

It was a small footstep. But Helmut paused.

Although he had only heard those footsteps a few times, they were familiar to his ears. They sounded as loud as thunder.

Helmut’s gaze was drawn to it as if captured.

Creak. The lock opened, and the door moved. The hem of a long skirt entered first.

The blonde hair shining in the light was dazzling. An elegant noble lady soon revealed herself.

Not in her usual flamboyant dress, but in something close to casual wear, as if she had briefly stepped out.

The door closed behind her.

Helmut, who had been frozen, gave a brief greeting.

“I greet Your Grace, the Duchess.”

To come looking for him at such an hour. It was uncharacteristic of her cautious nature. There must have been something she wanted to confirm.

His heart pounded faster.

But just like Helmut, who maintained his outward composure, her expression remained serene.

Margret spoke calmly.

“I heard you train at this hour every day.”

Helmut’s room was frequently visited by attendants. Perhaps they were also there to monitor him.

Helmut usually informed the attendant when he came down to train with his sword.

“Yes.”

“I don’t have much time… I have something to ask. Will you answer me?”

Margret didn’t hesitate and got straight to the point.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa didn’t have much time to move without being noticed.

To avoid anyone noticing, she had carefully come here.

Helmut nodded.

“Please ask.”

“Show me the mark you mentioned earlier.”

“Yes.”

Margret didn’t explain the reason, and Helmut didn’t ask. He simply moved.

He approached the cloak placed in one corner of the training ground and searched the pockets. From his hand, a golden object was drawn.

Seeing the dented surface of the pendant, Margret’s eyes trembled like the surface of water.

As if something had caught in the net of memory.

“This is it.”

Margret snatched the pendant with trembling hands.

The lid opened, and she saw her own image drawn inside. As her mind recognized it, strength left her hands.

Clang! The pendant fell to the floor, heavily reverberating through the air.

Margret was now trembling all over. Her gaze, which had been fixed on the pendant, lifted.

A voice overflowing with all sorts of emotions escaped her lips.

“Helmut.”

Her two hands, which had uttered his name like a groan, stretched out towards the void.

Helmut embraced his mother who was coming to hug him. The embrace was very warm.

No, it wasn’t her that was warm. It felt like his insides were burning.

“Helmut.”

His mother called again with a voice mixed with sobs. Calling her returned child.

She was crying. Her shoulder, wet with tears, was warm.

It felt like dawn breaking. Helmut felt as if he had lived for this moment.

Alea’s warning was forgotten, and Helmut realized that this was inevitable for him.

It was decided from the moment he chose to come to Renosa, no, from the moment he saw his mother.

If he had to pay a price for this moment, he would gladly pay it.

That was his resolution and determination.



H.F.C Chapter 243 ( Part 1):
				“How did you come to have the pendant?”

“The one who took me in after I was abandoned in the Forest of Roots later gave it to me.”

Margret and Helmut continued their conversation. It was mainly Margret asking questions and Helmut answering.

He needed to explain from the beginning, but somehow his throat felt tight.

Moreover, he wasn’t sure if Margret would be able to accept the entire truth, which is why it turned out this way.

‘I wonder how Mother will think of Elaga.’

A leopard the size of a house, and a demonic beast at that. Margret was a noblewoman who had lived a graceful life and was different from Alea, who could be flexible in her thinking as a mage. Helmut knew at least that much.

Before long, Margret’s tears had stopped. She was holding Helmut’s hand tightly and listening intently to his words.

Her blue eyes warmly embraced him, as if urging him to continue speaking with trust.

“You say you are the disciple of Sword Saint Darien?”

“Yes.”

“That’s remarkable. The bloodline of Renosa has always excelled in swordsmanship.”

Now it was time to ask how he had come out of the forest.

But suddenly, Margret frowned.

“I think we need to stop here. It seems difficult for me to stay away any longer. I must return.”

Margret had secretly slipped away. Now it was time for her to go back.

“Yes.”

“Rest. We’ll talk again next time.”

Helmut watched Margret’s figure as she turned around, composing her disheveled expression.

The door opened and closed, leaving him alone in the training ground.

It felt as though he had awakened from a dream.

But the lingering emotions remained.

It was a night that felt as if he had gained everything. Somehow, he wanted to talk to someone.

‘Alea said she wouldn’t be able to contact me.’

She must be conducting a long, focused experiment with the dungeon.

For the first time, Helmut felt a clear sense of dissatisfaction with his girlfriend.

“…She’ll probably contact me soon.”

Until then, he had no idea how things with his mother would unfold.

*

Michael had grown quite close to Leon. Michael had an exceptional talent for winning people’s hearts.

Michael acted as if he had a purpose in recruiting Leon into the Black Wing Knights.

On the other hand, he behaved as if Helmut, merely the winner of the lower-grade tournament, wasn’t even worth considering.

Leon was a high-ranking noble with a lofty attitude, a boy who had always lived as an honor student.

He was not the type to easily open his heart, but he couldn’t resist Michael’s blatant favoritism and eloquence.

While having tea with Leon, Michael skillfully guided the conversation to his desired topic.

“You must have swung your sword a lot during the tournament. How about getting it checked? Ratona’s blacksmith is quite good. I heard some competitors bought their swords from Ratona.”

Leon responded nonchalantly.

“Helmut did. His previous sword seemed like a fine blade, so I wonder why he suddenly changed it.”

It was the answer Michael had been hoping for.

“Is that so? Maybe his sword was damaged?”

“It was fine when we sparred on the way here… Ah, never mind.”

Leon hastily closed his mouth. Michael could guess the outcome of their sparring from his attitude.

Michael’s eyes narrowed. But he smoothly let it pass without pressing the issue.

“I see. He must have found a sword he liked.”

A short while later, Michael naturally concluded the conversation and left. He had heard what he wanted.

It was something he could have found out more quickly, but he did not rush. Michael walked, lost in thought.

‘So, he did change his sword. Where could his previous sword be?’

It was a Sword Saint’s sword. It wouldn’t be left just anywhere. He would always carry it. Perhaps in a cloak with spatial expansion magic.

Hyde also had one. Helmut wouldn’t have expected to see Michael in Renosa.

So, he wouldn’t have bought a new, expensive cloak with spatial expansion magic.

Even a stealthy entry into Helmut’s room to inspect his belongings would remove any doubt that Helmut was Hyde.

Michael realized one thing.

‘Charlotte must have known. She’s hiding something too.’

It was an unpleasant thought. Charlotte didn’t trust Michael.

Michael knew this well. Yet, it was unacceptable that she was hiding something from him.

Michael also understood Charlotte’s nature.

Charlotte was raised as the Grand Duke’s daughter. She knew she shouldn’t easily give her heart to others and indeed had a detached side.

Charlotte was hiding the truth from Michael to protect Helmut.

She didn’t want Michael to harm Helmut.

‘She wouldn’t go to such lengths to protect just a skilled commoner senior.’

Michael pressured Charlotte as if it were related to the Grand Duchy’s security.

Yet, she kept silent, indicating she held Helmut in special regard. It wasn’t romantic interest.

‘Does Charlotte feel something similar to what I feel?’

They were twins. Unfortunately, there was no such thing as empathy between them, but he could guess. Charlotte was simple-minded.

‘What worries me more is Mother.’



H.F.C Chapter 243 ( Part 2):
				A child who might be the Grand Duke’s illegitimate offspring. The Grand Duke often left Ratona for long periods, leaving the Mother behind.

During those times, the Grand Duke could have had an affair.

What Michael found strange was something else.

He couldn’t believe that the thorough and cold-blooded Grand Duke would have allowed a Rinosa bloodline to grow up outside his control.

‘It’s unsettling to dismiss it as a collateral line.’

There was something nagging at him inside. An inexplicable feeling.

Michael had ordered an investigation into Helmut, but due to the short time, not much had been uncovered.

Greta Academy had stringent security.

Michael knew that before attending Greta Academy, Helmut had been a mercenary, and about his supporter, Instructor Ethan Kudrow, and his academy friends.

‘There might be more if we investigate further.’

Time was needed. What Michael couldn’t guess was why Helmut attended the academy.

Helmut was hiding himself. It was strange for someone of Renosa’s bloodline to hide.

Neither Michael nor Charlotte nor anyone knew Helmut was of Renosa’s bloodline.

At least no one would target Helmut for that reason. If there was another enemy, Michael didn’t know who they were or why they targeted Helmut.

‘For now, I’ll keep an eye on him.’

Finding out why Helmut was staying in Ratona was the urgent task. He must have a purpose.

If that purpose was to meet the Grand Duke and get his existence acknowledged.

‘Then I must take action somehow.’

He couldn’t just eliminate him. The Grand Duchess was not a mere figurehead.

Such an event wouldn’t be overlooked or tolerated in the palace. Also, Michael had no guarantee he could certainly eliminate Helmut. He could endanger himself.

Hyde was an extraordinary talent, and if Hyde was Helmut, it would take many of the Black Wing Knights to deal with him.

However, no matter how absent the Grand Duke was, moving the Black Wing Knights without the Grand Duchess’s consent was impossible for Michael.

So, even if he wanted to eliminate Helmut, there was no feasible means.

If he couldn’t harm him as an enemy, it would be advantageous in many ways to make him an ally.

‘I don’t want to eliminate him either.’

Michael admitted readily. Of course, this judgment was premised on Helmut not coveting the Rinosa heir position and not doing anything harmful to Rinosa.

‘Well then, let’s go.’

Michael’s footsteps moved. He said they should meet often, so it should be fine to go see him often.

He hadn’t asked for permission, but informing would suffice. This was Ratona, and Helmut was a guest. How to treat a guest was the host’s decision.

After recovering from his illness, he was fortunate not to fall sick for a while. Having handled accumulated tasks, now was the optimal time for Michael to move.

“Where is he?”

Michael’s question was soon answered. The garden. Michael headed there immediately.

However, at the entrance of the garden, he saw a familiar face.

“Your Highness Michael.”

“The head maid. Is Mother here?”

The head maid, directly serving the Grand Duchess. Her presence meant his mother had visited Helmut.

Michael’s eyes, still smiling, grew sharp.

‘What does Mother know?’

His mother was showing interest in Helmut. She was trying to find out who he was in a subtle way as the Grand Duchess of Renosa. Michael had thought simply.

But something was bothering him.

“I will inform the Grand Duchess.”

“No, wait.”

Just then, he saw his mother. Michael looked at his mother standing in the garden from a distance.

Helmut was hidden behind a tree, so he could only see his mother’s side profile.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa was a wise and merciful woman with a stern side to others. That was the dignity of a grand noble.

Michael’s gaze, looking at his mother, wavered.

Her eyes. The look in his mother’s eyes was unfamiliar.

No, it was familiar.

It was the same look she had when gazing at Charlotte or him. A look filled with affection.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa would never look at an illegitimate child with such eyes.

Something inside him twisted. Michael’s thoughts were wrong.

Mother wasn’t wary of him. She wasn’t seeking him as the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

‘Why?’

An ominous premonition rose and quickly consumed him. To Michael, this meant something unknown was happening in Renosa.

A memory suddenly flashed through his mind. The corridor of portraits. The portrait with the empty space. He seemed to remember hearing something about it.

Michael spoke to his mother’s maid.

“I’ve just remembered an urgent matter. You don’t need to inform Mother.”

Michael turned around on the spot. His expression had grown cold. He had something to investigate.

He had never unearthed a hidden past before, but it didn’t seem impossible.



H.F.C Chapter 244 (Part 1):
				For the few days after welcoming new guests, Ratona’s palace was quiet and peaceful.

However, it wasn’t a relaxed atmosphere where one could leisurely go out for a stroll.

Even if the guests were granted some freedom.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa lightly summoned the guests.

Instead of holding a grand hunting event, she organized a simple archery competition.

With so few participants, it could hardly be called a competition.

A couple of targets were set up, and her children and Leon gathered in one place.

A few Black Wing Knights who were confident in their archery skills were selected to join.

The atmosphere was somewhat tense and awkward.

Even though it was a gathering of three members of the Renosa bloodline, it was far from comfortable.

Helmut, Charlotte, Michael.

Charlotte, who couldn’t be free from Michael’s suspicions, had a stern expression.

She had been deliberately avoiding Helmut. Under the pretext of greeting the Black Wing Knight Commander and focusing on training.

But there was one thing she found strange.

‘I heard that Mother and senior have been spending a lot of time together lately. Why is Mother getting close to him? It seems excessive to be out of suspicion.’

While tilting her head at this uncharacteristic behavior from her mother, Charlotte couldn’t guess the reason.

She had stopped paying attention to Helmut altogether and hardly conversed with her mother.

It was impossible to fathom the intentions of the ever-calm Grand Duchess.

“Please, come in.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa welcomed them with her usual benevolent smile.

The real reason she had arranged this event was to give her children a chance to bond under the pretext of a competition.

She wasn’t unaware that Michael was wary of Helmut.

Also, she hadn’t reached a conclusion on how to deal with Helmut.

Margret had been spending time visiting Helmut for the past few days.

Just following her heart.

The Grand Duke of Renosa was absent, and she had postponed her duties, decisions, and judgments as the Grand Duchess.

The child she thought she had lost forever had returned. Margret just wanted to be a mother to Helmut.

She felt new emotions every day, too insufficient to be called joy.

As if a part of her that had died was coming back to life.

Helmut’s return was the one miracle that had occurred in her life.

A completely unexpected miracle.

She had never earnestly prayed for it. The Grand Duchess of Renosa was too important a position to expect miracles, and grief had to be buried quickly.

‘I want to focus on the present, no matter what happens in the future.’

She wanted to spend time together, lavishing the affection she couldn’t give to the child she had lost.

Margret was Helmut’s mother. She hoped her firstborn would mingle with his siblings.

Of course, since Michael and Charlotte were completely unaware of this fact, they would be suspicious of Margret’s behavior.

‘I can only hope they’ll naturally be drawn to their own blood.’

Of the two younger siblings, at least Charlotte was more friendly towards Helmut. She had always been close to Helmut.

As soon as she saw Helmut, she bowed her head slightly, just as she had done at the academy.

“Senior Leon, Senior Helmut, have you been well?”

“Ah, yes.”

The atmosphere seemed to disregard the fact that she was the Duchess and Helmut was merely a commoner.

Helmut tilted his head as he looked at Charlotte.

“You look like a woman.”

Charlotte was wearing a dress. Not a simple, ordinary one, but an elaborate dress befitting the Duchess of the prosperous Renosa.

With her abundant black hair flowing down and adorned with jewels, Charlotte looked like a completely different person.

Yes, truly like a woman.

Leon, standing at a distance, spoke as if he was rather flustered.

“W-What disrespectful words to Her Highness the Grand Duchess.”

He flinched when he received Helmut’s gaze. He was still wary of Helmut. Charlotte smiled brightly.

“Please be at ease. While I’m attending the academy, I’ll just be Charlotte.”

“That means you’ll become Her Highness Charlotte after graduation.”

“Yes, that’s unavoidable. I am the Duchess of Renosa, after all.”

“I see.”

Helmut accepted it calmly. Although he wasn’t familiar with the human-specific system of status, there were countless unfamiliar things in the human world since he came out. There was nothing particularly new about it.

“Everyone seems to get along well. But I hope you won’t forget that I’m not an academy student.”

Michael, who appeared last, threw out words with a smile.



H.F.C Chapter 244 (Part 2):
				Michael was the Duke of Rinosa, and he didn’t speak comfortably with either Helmut or Leon.

However, Helmut received special treatment. He was the only commoner here.

Leon brightened up at him.

“Your Highness Michael. How have you been feeling?”

“I’m healthy. More than ever.”

Helmut faced Michael. He had heard that the day before yesterday, or was it, Michael had come and gone while he was in the garden with his mother.

He didn’t know why Michael had just left, but it was clear that Michael didn’t much like seeing him together with his mother.

He was a guy with many issues. Michael’s smile sank more coldly than before.

Despite saying he wanted to see him often, he didn’t pay much attention to Helmut.

However, Helmut didn’t think Michael had completely lost interest in him.

‘He’s probably intensely investigating my background.’

Helmut had been careful to erase his tracks. Even the formidable Black Hawk couldn’t discern where he came from.

The legend of the Forest of Roots, where no one who entered came out, blinded human eyes.

It was an unshakeable, powerful prejudice.

Helmut didn’t think Michael was an exception. Although he couldn’t be completely at ease.

“Do you know how to shoot a bow?”

Helmut asked without much thought. Michael’s expression wavered.

“Helmut.”

Leon called his name softly, seeming flustered. He had grown bolder since getting close to Michael.

“Do you think I can’t shoot a bow just because I can’t handle a sword?”

“Yes.”

Helmut answered without hesitation. It wasn’t particularly out of disrespect, but just the apparent fact.

It didn’t seem like Michael’s slender, girlish hands could properly pull a strong bowstring.

Michael’s smile turned fierce.

“Unfortunately, I do know how to shoot a bow. It’s one of my few active hobbies.”
