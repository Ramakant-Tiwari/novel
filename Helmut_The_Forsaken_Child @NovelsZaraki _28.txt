“I see.”

Responding halfheartedly, Helmut guessed that Michael would surely use a magic bow.

That was true. Michael was skilled at compensating for his lack of physical abilities in other ways.

But anyway, to hit the target with an arrow, one needs a certain level of skill.

“Are you confident in your archery skills, Helmut?”

“Senior Helmut’s skills are amazing. He can easily shoot down birds flying in the sky.”

Charlotte intervened subtly. She had seen Helmut hunting during their camping trip.

“In that case, I look forward to it. Shall we make a bet? On your victory or someone else’s. The one who scores the highest with ten arrows wins.”

Michael smiled softly. Helmut didn’t bother to ask about the stakes of the bet. He simply said,

“It’s better not to make bets you’ll lose.”

His tone was calm, as if giving advice. It was so nonchalant that it seemed to ask why they were doing such a foolish thing.

Michael’s expression wavered once again. It was an answer that left him both dumbfounded and at a loss for words.

“That’s quite some confidence. Are you saying you can hit the bullseye with all ten arrows?”

“Of course.”

The answer was so firm that everyone was at a loss for words. The Grand Duchess of Rinosa, who had been listening, chuckled softly.

“Then would you show us your skills? Instead of making a bet, I’ll give a prize to the winner. I haven’t thought of anything yet, but it will be a sufficient reward.”

“If you wish.”

Helmut answered briefly. It was an attitude that seemed arrogant even though he was telling the truth.

But Helmut’s job was simply to prove his words. The Grand Duchess of Rinosa smoothly deflected.

“I look forward to it.”

The guests’ turn was later. To liven up the atmosphere, the knights shot their arrows first.

They were Black Wing Knights. Their archery skills were indeed excellent. The scores ranged from 1 to 10 points, increasing towards the center, and the target was quite detailed in its scoring.

But they hit their arrows close to the center almost every time. 10 points, 9 points, 8 points. They never went below 7 points.

“How about having Helmut go last? He seems confident.”

Michael suggested. It was a calculation that the person shooting last would feel pressure thinking about the scores of those who went before.

But Helmut was someone who wouldn’t be affected by such pressure at all. He nodded slightly.

“I don’t mind.”

He then stepped forward with ten arrows. Charlotte’s archery skills were also excellent. True to her honor student status, Charlotte scored a decent 90 points. It was similar to the Black Wing Knights’ performance.

Unexpectedly, Leon didn’t seem to have much talent for archery. Most of his arrows were evenly distributed across almost all score ranges.

Having hit the 10-point mark with only one arrow, he explained with a perplexed face.

“I haven’t done much of this kind of thing.”

Naturally, he drifted away from the winning ranks.

The order right before Helmut was Michael.

Michael raised his personal magic bow. It might seem like cheating, but no one objected to the Duke of Renosa doing so.

The Grand Duchess of Renosa also seemed to turn a blind eye to his unfairness as if it were natural. In an instant, ten arrows cut through the air and were shot.

“98 points.”

Michael smiled, narrowing his eyes. It was a triumphant smile.

He could confidently claim to be the best archer in Renosa.

Although he had nothing to boast about regarding almost everything related to physical prowess, even if he borrowed the power of magic, there was no one with superior skills in archery than him.

The result wouldn’t change even if someone else held his bow.

His magic bow only slightly enhanced strength, not controlling the delicate use of that power or angle calculations.

Unless someone hit the bullseye with almost all arrows, Michael’s victory seemed certain.

Helmut lightly picked up the bow.

And the moment he shot all ten arrows, a change occurred in what seemed to be a predetermined result.



H.F.C Chapter 245 (Part 1):
				The first arrow hit the center of the target.

10 points. And the second arrow broke the first arrow and lodged itself precisely in the same spot.

The same thing happened repeatedly. Until all 10 arrows were embedded in the target, everyone watched Helmut’s skills without being able to look away.

It was an unbelievable feat.

Despite not using Vis, the strength with which he drew the bowstring carried formidable power.

Enough to shatter the arrows already lodged in the target. When Helmut drew the bowstring for the last arrow, the target, which had been precariously standing, toppled backward with a thud.

A servant ran to check the arrows embedded in the target and shouted.

“10 points!”

A perfect score of 100 points. A profound silence fell over the surroundings in the wake of the astounding feat.

It was an overwhelming moment that went beyond merely excellent skill.

“It seems I have won.”

Helmut cast a nonchalant glance at Michael.

Michael raised a painted smile on his pale face.

“Your archery skills are amazing. I’m glad I didn’t make a bet.”

A talent to be envied, no, more than that. It was exceedingly exceptional. As if alive.

Such a person is not meant to be under anyone. He was not someone to be wielded as a sword at another’s whim.

This was regardless of how great the capacity of the master might be.

Helmut was never meant to be that way. Michael vividly felt that.

Helmut nodded. Charlotte also belatedly offered her congratulations.

“Senior Helmut, you’re truly impressive.”

“It seems Helmut is the winner.”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa, who had been watching Helmut with surprise, was now smiling.

Her gaze toward Helmut held a gentle affection. It was a change that a sensitive person could notice.

“What should we give as a prize?”

Just as the Grand Duchess, who had been silently pondering, was about to speak again.

“Your Highness, the Grand Duchess!”

A loud cry echoed. A knight urgently rushed in from afar.

He was dressed in the uniform of the Black Wing Knights. His demeanor was so unusual that no one reprimanded his rudeness.

“It’s an urgent message!”

“What is it?”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa responded gracefully, raising her eyebrows. The knight glanced around.

Leon and Helmut, who were outsiders, stood plainly there. It was not something to be spoken aloud in front of outsiders. It was quicker to clear people out than to change the location.

The Grand Duchess ordered that the prize for the winner would be decided later and that everyone should disperse.

With that, the archery competition she had hosted concluded.

Helmut and Leon left immediately.

Of course, Leon was indifferent, but Helmut listened attentively.

Using Vis, he could hear conversations from a distance.

“Report. What’s the matter?”

After a few minutes of impatient waiting, the knight finally spoke.

“His Highness, the Grand Duke, has gone missing!”

“What did you say…?”

At that moment, the Grand Duchess’s face showed intense agitation. As if she had heard the palace had collapsed.

Michael and Charlotte’s faces also froze.

Helmut briefly glanced at his mother. The Grand Duchess spoke with a pale face.

“Let’s discuss this inside.”

*

“There was an ambush.”

In a tense atmosphere, the report continued in the presence of the Grand Duchess of Renosa, Charlotte, and Michael.

The Grand Duke of Renosa usually did not inform the Grand Duchess of his detailed whereabouts.

He would generally say he was going to inspect certain areas and that he would be back after a certain period, asking her to take care of the palace.

That was all he would say.

The Grand Duke cherished the Grand Duchess but cherished Renosa even more.

As a rare ruler who meticulously inspected every corner of Renosa, his schedule always had many variables.

This incident was also a result of those variables.

“There was a report of strange occurrences in the mountain range extending from the empire to Renosa. His Highness was inspecting a nearby mine and decided to personally look around the mountain. That’s the last report we have before this incident. And…….”

The knight continued solemnly.

“Something happened there.”



H.F.C Chapter 245 (Part 2):
				“What do you mean something happened?”

“His Highness was moving with a small elite group. However, not long after, signal flares were launched from the mountain, and the nearby troops headed there.

Up until that point, we did not think anything unusual would happen. His Highness was accompanied by fifteen members of the Black Wing Knights, after all.

But when the troops arrived, all they could see was dug-up ground and bodies. Torn apart bodies of the Black Wing Knights.

Seven have been confirmed. This incident occurred just a few hours ago, and this report was only recently delivered to the palace. The thick fog made it impossible to search further. We await your orders on how to proceed.”

The Grand Duchess’s lips trembled. Charlotte and Michael’s eyes also showed shock.

Especially Michael, who had wiped away his usual smile entirely.

Had they ever faced such a crisis before?

Charlotte shouted as if vomiting her words.

“Who could have done such a thing!”

“As I mentioned earlier, strange phenomena have been occurring. A hunter in a nearby village, barely alive, spoke of a ‘beast.’ It’s possible that some terrifying magical beast has appeared along the mountain range.”

The reporting knight lowered his head as if guilty.

“So, His Highness’s safety remains unconfirmed?”

“Yes. The frequent fog makes it difficult to search. Several soldiers dispatched to the mountain have already gone missing. We need elite forces.”

It was a foregone conclusion that all members of the Black Wing Knights guarding this Ratona place, including the commander, would be deployed.

But that alone was insufficient. The current missing person was the ruler of Renosa. The Grand Duchess, calming her shock, thought rationally.

“We need not only elite forces but also someone to assess the situation. We cannot just sit here and wait not knowing what has happened to His Highness.”

The Grand Duchess spoke decisively.

“I must go personally.”

Michael and Charlotte simultaneously looked at their mother. They were surprised but for different reasons than before. Michael was the first to object.

“With His Highness missing, it’s unacceptable for you to leave the palace too, Mother.”

“Indeed, Mother should stay and protect the palace.”

Charlotte agreed. But the Grand Duchess shook her head.

“Someone has to go there. It could be dangerous. If that’s the case, I think it’s right that I go, not you two who are to inherit Renosa.”

Margret was also a mother. She could not send both Charlotte and Michael.

If someone had to go, it should be Charlotte, not Michael, who couldn’t wield a sword.

But Margret could not allow that either. She could not risk losing either of her children. It was almost an obsession.

Moreover, without revealing Helmut’s existence, if Charlotte were to die in an unfortunate accident, Michael would be left alone to inherit Renosa.

Assuming the Grand Duke was dead, it would be a simplified succession line, but it would be extremely unfair.

Although the Grand Duchess acted as if she supported Michael, she could not support such an outcome.

It was a decision worthy of the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

However, if she could not risk her children, Charlotte, too, could not risk her mother.

Charlotte was a swordswoman. A strong swordswoman. One who would not retreat and would fight to the death against any enemy.

A swordswoman wields a sword to win, to protect with her own hands, to achieve what she wants.

This was true even if she held the noble status of Grand Duchess.

Charlotte declared firmly.

“Mother, I will go. Please stay here with Michael and protect Ratona.”

“That cannot be. It’s too dangerous.”

“I can wield a sword. I am quite skilled and have good stamina. I can escape if it becomes too dangerous. But Mother cannot.”

Charlotte pointed out the truth. As a commander, Charlotte was the most suitable.

Michael was the same as his mother. His stamina was no different from the Grand Duchess’s. Going there without collapsing was the most he could help with.

Michael, being rational, knew his limits and did not step forward.

He was good at distinguishing between what he could and could not do.

This allowed him to avoid danger, but it was painful that he could not step forward in such a crucial moment as a successor.

If Charlotte succeeded in this mission, her position as a successor would be further strengthened.

Michael was more concerned about that than the possibility of the Grand Duke being dead.

The Grand Duchess knew it was the most appropriate but still shook her head.

“What if I lose you too?”

“There is a way.”

Charlotte was not reckless. Saving the Grand Duke was important, but minimizing sacrifice was essential.

She calmly devised a plan.

An idea flashed through her mind.

“Senior Helmut is at the palace. He is an incredible senior. I will go with Senior Helmut. If I explain the situation and ask for his help, I believe he will assist.”

Somehow, she felt safe with him. Helmut was the strongest swordsman she had ever seen. Perhaps even stronger than her master, the Black Wing Knights’ commander.

The Grand Duchess’s expression wavered. She soon nodded, knowing she had no choice.

“Alright.”



H.F.C Chapter 246 (Part 1):
				“Senior, I’m sorry for the request.”

Charlotte bowed her head slightly. She briefly explained her situation.

It seemed like a foregone conclusion that Helmut would accompany her.

Although he couldn’t refuse, Helmut felt a strange sensation after hearing her story.

Charlotte surely considered him close. But to try to recruit even a guest for such a dangerous and secret mission.

‘Should I call it practical? Or brazen?’

He was treated with great hospitality under the pretext of being the swordsmanship tournament winner.

Moreover, the Grand Duke of Renosa, though not present in his memories, was his father.

He couldn’t leave Charlotte in danger either. She was his sister, after all.

There was no absolute reason he couldn’t go. However.

‘The problem is parting with my mother again.’

That didn’t sit well with him. If the entire Black Wing Knights were mobilized, the capital would be relatively empty. Michael didn’t have the military strength to protect their mother.

Other knights and soldiers would remain to guard Ratona, but Helmut was concerned.

The very fact that he had to leave his mother in a situation where he couldn’t protect her.

Of course, he knew there was a simple way to resolve this confusion.

Defeat that mysterious beast and find the Grand Duke.

Even if the Grand Duke was already dead, then at least retrieve his body.

Although there would likely be turmoil until a new Grand Duke of Renosa took the position.

‘Michael will probably inherit the Grand Duke position.’

Charlotte would want Renosa’s chaos to end as quickly as possible, and Michael would never want to give up the Grand Duke position.

It was obvious which of the two would step down – the one with less ambition.

If Michael became Grand Duke, Helmut’s position would become even more ambiguous.

Their mother didn’t seem likely to let go of Helmut, but she can’t forcibly keep him against Michael’s opposition either.

Once Michael became the master of Renosa, there would be limits to what she could do.

‘I need to move as quickly as possible at this point. There’s no time to hesitate.’

The best option was to rescue the Grand Duke. He didn’t need to be responsible for his mother’s safety.

Charlotte, understanding Helmut’s hesitation somehow, gently urged him again.

“Still, you should help your junior, right?”

For some reason, her request was confident. Charlotte was the Duchess of Renosa.

Even when asking someone for a favor, her confidence never wavered.

Helmut gave a distant reply.

“I’m a mercenary by origin. Will you pay the commission fee?”

Helmut wasn’t the type to simply follow along or freely offer goodwill to others.

Though a guest in this palace, he had a cool-headed personality that took care of his own interests.

Charlotte likely thought the same.

And Charlotte wasn’t stingy when it came to paying.

“Of course. I’ll pay you a generous commission fee on the honor of the Grand Duke’s family. Although that’s not for me to decide.”

When Helmut showed his willingness to agree, Charlotte smiled brightly before her face turned serious again.

“Mother wishes to have a private conversation with you.”

“Alright.”

“We’ll depart immediately after. Please be prepared. We don’t have much time.”

Charlotte left immediately, saying she needed to prepare for departure as well.

She seemed surprisingly composed for someone who had just learned of her father’s disappearance.

As a member of the grand nobility ruling a country, one must maintain composure in any situation.

Moreover, Charlotte was a strong swordswoman. She had already steeled herself mentally.

Helmut looked around the luxurious room assigned to him.

There wasn’t much to pack. His preparation ended with taking his sword.

Would something be different when he returned here? It was impossible to know yet.

With a premonition, Helmut left the room.



H.F.C Chapter 246 (Part 2):
				“Will you be alright?”

The Grand Duchess of Renosa he faced asked quietly. Mother’s blue eyes gazed at Helmut, distorted with concern.

“It will be dangerous.”

“You want me to go, right?”

Helmut replied calmly. He wasn’t blaming her.

If his mother wanted it, Helmut had to go.

She was Helmut’s mother, and that alone gave her the right to command him. That right was virtually absolute.

They say children who are neglected by their parents become more devoted in order to be loved.

Helmut was even abandoned.

Though it probably wasn’t his mother’s intention. That’s why he wanted to show his strength, to prove he was a child capable of fulfilling his mother’s wishes and more.

Perhaps Helmut wanted to prove his necessity to his mother. To avoid being abandoned again.

“Of course, I do. But I also don’t.”

With a sorrowful expression, his mother continued slowly.

“I am the Grand Duchess of Renosa. I have a duty to make choices for Renosa.”

Her wavering heart had firmed. She was thinking not as a mother, but as the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

“I heard you were planning to go yourself. I understand that Charlotte and I going is the best choice.”

Helmut thought so too. His mother was far from being capable in combat. Against such powerful beasts, she would only be a burden.

In fact, Charlotte wasn’t much different. If he went with her, Helmut would have to consider her safety as well.

Moving alone would be most convenient, but Helmut understood that someone from the Renosa Grand Duke’s family with the authority to command troops needed to accompany him.

“Don’t be disappointed. I think this is a good opportunity.”

Helmut understood what his mother was trying to say.

This was an appropriate opportunity for Helmut to be accepted as a member of Renosa.

Achieving merit. If Helmut rescued the Grand Duke of Renosa, the Grand Duke could accept him more easily as well.

Although Helmut couldn’t be officially recognized due to the Temple, he could be accepted unofficially at least.

Even if it meant risking antagonizing the Temple.

If the Temple found out, Helmut could simply leave on his own.

Renosa could claim they didn’t know he still had the Dark Seed.

Helmut appeared normal on the outside, and he was an honor student attending the academy normally in Baden.

‘With Alea, and her master Heike who is also a Temple public enemy, living away from the Temple’s eyes isn’t difficult. Even without confronting them directly.’

Thinking positively, it wasn’t that dangerous.

The Temple is hostile to those with the Seed of Darkness.

But recently two High Priests died. The Temple’s power has weakened, and they’re in conflict with Basor.

They couldn’t afford to make an enemy of Renosa as well.

Although the Temple and the Empire are still on good terms, the Temple couldn’t exert absolute influence on any country.

Renosa might face some disadvantages, but they wouldn’t be too severe.

If they threatened Renosa, Helmut was ready to destroy the Temple at any time.

He knew two high-ranking temple enemies, both archmages.

Basor’s Luke Yeager also owed Helmut.

Though he had never formed a faction before, Helmut felt it wouldn’t be impossible.

After all, Helmut was born with the bloodline of rulers. He was the legitimate heir of Renosa with noble blood.

“Just as Charlotte believes in your skills, I believe in them too. Though I don’t have the eye to judge a swordsman’s ability, Charlotte has high standards.”

In some ways, his mother was fair. She initially offered to go herself, unafraid of losing her life.

But Charlotte stepped up, saying it would be better if she went instead. Suggesting a better option.

The Grand Duchess agreed to that persuasion ultimately because it was the choice befitting a Grand Duchess.

For Margret, motherly affection couldn’t surpass duty.

If Charlotte had to take risks, Helmut could too.

Michael was left out of this calculation because he was weak, not for any other reason.

“And if possible, could you make sure Charlotte doesn’t get hurt?”

“I will.”

Helmut readily agreed. Defeating the mysterious powerful beast and rescuing the Grand Duke.

And protecting Charlotte. These were the two duties given to him.

To some, it might feel like a mountain of responsibility.

“I believe in you.”

With those brief words, his mother willingly passed that weight onto Helmut.

Though she said it couldn’t be helped, she was the one who had abandoned him. There was no time for tenderness.

But Helmut was also a member of Renosa. That’s what bloodline means to grand nobility.

Just by being born with that blood, one shoulders responsibilities.

His mother was recognizing him in her own way.

His strength, and the fact that he too was a member of the Grand Duke’s family.

Strangely, Helmut could clearly feel this fact. And surprisingly, he felt no aversion to it.

“I’ll see you when I return.”

With those final words, Helmut rose from his seat.

There was no time to delay. Once decided, they would move as quickly as possible.

Helmut soon joined the troops led by Charlotte. A grave expression colored everyone’s faces.

“I hope you both return safely.”

Michael, uncharacteristically without a smile, saw them off.

His face was strange, not simply cold.

Helmut and Charlotte standing opposite him looked like siblings even to strangers.

In contrast, Michael looked like an outsider, not mixed with their blood.

“Take care, Charlotte.”

As he said those words, Michael’s gaze shifted. His eyes twisted slightly as he looked at Helmut.

After a moment, Michael uttered:

“And you too, Helmut.”

“Yes.”

Helmut replied briefly.

With that, they immediately left Ratona and set out for where the Grand Duke had disappeared.



H.F.C Chapter 247 (Part 1):
				‘Where am I….’

Several days had passed since the Seed of Darkness had bloomed.

However, he was still a Platinum Mercenary. Vis is the power of the mind.

He hadn’t completely lost his sanity yet. Occasionally, his rationality returned.

He blinked. As the pitch-black darkness that veiled his vision brightened, he became aware of himself.

A monster drenched in blood. The aura of dark energy seeping out of his body tainted the grass around him a murky color.

His moments of sanity were becoming increasingly rare.

Eventually, his reason would never surface again.

Even so, there was nothing he could do.

The water had already overflowed, and even an Archmage couldn’t reverse it.

He might eventually merge with his instincts and become an even more brutal demonic beast.

But one thing was clear: he was no longer his own master.

He became aware of himself, perched on a tree, frozen like a statue.

He was injured. His whole body ached. It seemed his nerves weren’t completely numb, as he could still feel pain.

He jerked his head around recklessly, trying to shake off the chains that bound him, but it was futile. The feeling of being consumed was chilling.

Yet, even knowing he couldn’t resist, he didn’t wish to end his enslaved life.

Those who gained life through the Seed of Darkness clung desperately to it.

Becoming beasts, they lost themselves, slaughtering and destroying everything in sight.

Humans dominated by the instincts of dark energy were more savage than demonic beasts.

“Grr…”

This time, his physical body had taken a hit. While the Seed of Darkness was repairing his flesh, he momentarily regained his senses.

He looked around and noticed a torn-up corpse.

The blood, still warm, had not long ceased to flow, staining the ground.

‘Knights?’

He narrowed his eyes. A sword lay on the ground. A trained body. The attire was that of a black knight.

He recognized his opponent.

‘I killed… the Black Wing Knights.’

He grinned wickedly. A savage feeling welled up. Even as a Platinum Mercenary, facing such knights recklessly wasn’t an option.

Images he had seen but not registered came flooding back.

He remembered who he had fought.

‘The Grand Duke.’

The Grand Duke of Renosa. A grand noble who ruled the Principality of Renosa. The sight of him had filled him with a murderous rage.

He was originally a mercenary. A commoner.

Deep in his heart was resentment towards those of high status who controlled him with money.

He had targeted the Grand Duke but only managed to injure him in a surprise attack, failing to kill him.

The protection of the Black Wing Knights was fierce. They had torn his skin to shreds.

But he was strong. The Seed of Darkness had granted him incredible power.

He had torn apart several Black Wing Knights.

‘Where did he go….’

His beast-like eyes scanned the surroundings. He felt an odd thirst.

While some knights held him back, the other Black Wing Knights had carried off their bleeding master.

Sensing defeat, they scattered to protect their master.

In this thick fog, they wouldn’t know each other’s whereabouts.

He would find the Grand Duke. Would drinking his blood and ripping out his heart quench this thirst?

The savage demonic feeling rose. He licked his lips with his tongue.

“Grrr.”

A beastly growl escaped between his teeth, almost like laughter.

He began to move slowly.

In this fog, to find the master of Renosa.

They couldn’t have gone far.

*

It was a dark cave. A small cave near a cliff, hidden by bushes.

The entrance was narrow, but the inside was relatively spacious.

It could fit a few people inside.

There were four people inside. Four adult men squeezed together, speaking in hushed tones.

“What kind of monster is that?”

One of the Black Wing Knights muttered. His face showed tension and fear.

Memories of fleeing with their master, leaving their comrades fighting desperately, resurfaced.

Only after escaping a considerable distance and hiding here could they sigh with relief.

“Be quiet! It might follow us.”

A comrade warned. Sweat beaded on their spines. They had survived because they were closest to the Grand Duke. It wasn’t that they were specifically chosen.

“Your Highness, the Grand Duke.”



H.F.C Chapter 247 (Part 2):
				One of the knights checked on the Grand Duke. His complexion was pale, unconscious.

There was a long wound on the Grand Duke’s abdomen. As if a giant leopard’s paw had clawed through.

The bleeding had stopped somewhat, but it wasn’t a wound that would heal naturally.

The moment something flew towards them like a ball, the Grand Duke became half-dead.

It was a miracle he didn’t die instantly. Protecting the Grand Duke from the next blow was all the Black Wing Knights, standing like scarecrows, could do.

One knight assessed calmly.

“The bleeding has stopped, but he’s lost too much blood. No matter how robust he is, he needs treatment and rest.”

“For the Grand Duke’s sake, we need to leave this place as soon as possible.”

“What do you suggest we do?”

Silence fell at the question from one near the entrance. They needed to move the Grand Duke for treatment. But out there in the fog was the beast that had slaughtered the Black Wing Knights.

The knights had split up instinctively, knowing they couldn’t flee together.

There was no time to escape to a village. They just needed to get as far away from the beast as possible.

Finding this hideout was a miracle.

They had erased all traces at the entrance.

They could only hope the creature couldn’t track the scent of the Grand Duke’s blood.

“Instead of all moving together, it’s better to call for help. Bring someone, preferably a mage.”

They continued their low-voiced conversation. They had to decide their next steps.

They weren’t of ranks to give commands to each other.

“There’s no way we three can handle that thing.”

“One should stay, and the other two should move.”

“But we need to know the location of this place to tell where the Grand Duke is.”

“The problem is we don’t know where we are either. Can we even determine a direction in this foggy mountain?”

“That’s a fair point. This fog won’t stay thick forever. It’s better to move when it clears a bit.”

“News must have reached Ratona. Support troops will arrive soon and start a search.”

“If the Knight Commander comes…”

Hope showed on their faces.

Even among the Black Wing Knights, the Commander who guards the system and the knights under him were highly skilled.

Those who came here were just escorts accompanying the Grand Duke on a light outing. They hadn’t anticipated such danger.

“Let’s stay as quiet as mice until the fog clears.”

Fortunately, they had been camping, so each had a bit of dried food on them. They could hold out for a while.

When the opportunity arose, they would leave this place. A day or two. The Grand Duke should be able to hold out until then.

They spent the night on high alert, filled with anxiety.

*

The troops that had left the capital moved through a magic circle.

Four Black Wing Knights had returned to the main force. They were the ones who managed to maintain their sense of direction even in the fog.

Out of fifteen, seven had died, and four had returned.

The whereabouts of the remaining four were unknown. They didn’t even know how many were with the Grand Duke.

It was a devastating outcome. Never had there been an enemy inflicting such damage on the Black Wing Knights.

Charlotte’s face darkened.

“It’s a terrifying magical beast. How did such a creature end up in Renosa?”

Charlotte frowned, not out of fear.

Rescuing the Grand Duke from that creature in the forest seemed overwhelming.

“Wouldn’t it be better for you to stay here?”

Black Wing Knight Commander Alonso suggested. Even he, usually relaxed in front of his student Charlotte, had a slightly stern face.

“I don’t intend to push myself. I’ll stay by the Knight Commander’s side. Wouldn’t that be the safest? Also, while I may not be as skilled as the Black Wing Knights, I’d be more helpful in combat than regular soldiers. After all, even the soldiers will have to risk danger searching through the mountains.”

A larger group made searching easier. There would be sacrifices, but if the beast attacked, they would immediately know its location.

“There’s a lot of dark energy around here, making it hard to search with magic. It consumes a lot of magical power.”

The few mages were hired by Renosa.

They were quite skilled graduates from the Academy, but they had used a lot of magical power to move the many troops.

They had to reserve magical power for recovery magic. If the Grand Duke was injured, they would need to heal him.

Helmut, standing on one side, tilted his head.

‘It would be good if we could contact Alea.’

Alea would be an enormous force if she came.

But unfortunately, the incident occurred when she had cut off contact. It was regrettable, but nothing could be done.

Helmut raised his hand lightly. They were a large group that couldn’t move easily. Helmut was different.

“I’d like to move alone. I’ll act with signal flares.”

“Senior, it’s dangerous. The creature killed many Black Wing Knights. Even you can’t face it alone.”

Charlotte warned. But Helmut shook his head.

“No, I’ve fought many beasts. I’m used to fighting in the forest. In the worst case, I can at least save myself.”

Helmut wanted to go to ensure Charlotte’s safety.

Rather than dragging her along and fighting while protecting her, it was better to go alone and accomplish his goal.

With so many people around, Charlotte wouldn’t be in danger.

Helmut could venture into the forest, confront the demonic beast, and save the Grand Duke.

After all, he was his father. If he was still alive, he had to save him for his mother’s sake.

There was no time to waste.



H.F.C Chapter 248 (Part 1):
				The Black Wing Knights’ Commander, who had been quietly listening, stepped forward.

“Let him do as he wishes. Think of it as scouting ahead.”

An exceptional swordsman can gauge the skill of their opponent.

Although it wasn’t overtly expressed, Helmut possessed extraordinary skills.

He wouldn’t have any intention of harming the Grand Duke if he found him first.

Above all, Helmut resembled the Grand Duke so closely, even in the Knight Commander’s eyes. To the point of suspecting they were of the same bloodline.

Given the circumstances, he couldn’t speak of it openly.

Charlotte, upon hearing Alonso’s words, finally showed an expression of acceptance.

Though she had wanted to minimize any risk to their guest, now wasn’t the time to worry about such things.

All possible means had to be employed.

She looked earnestly at Helmut and spoke.

“I don’t want you to get caught up in this and end up in danger. Please, be careful.”

Ultimately, she was the one with the authority here, being of Renosa’s bloodline.

After a slight hesitation, Charlotte added firmly.

“And if possible, please save the Grand Duke.”

It was a heartfelt request. Helmut slowly nodded.

“Alright.”

Helmut promptly left the scene.

Following him, the soldiers dispersed into the now-thinning mist.

They maintained a close communication network to search for the beasts or the Grand Duke’s location.

Charlotte also moved along with the Black Wing Knights’ Commander.

Hoping they could secure the Grand Duke’s safety swiftly.

*

In the mountains. How much time had passed?

As the fog thinned and the surroundings became clearer, he who had been hiding in a hollow old tree carefully moved.

His heart tightened with tension.

‘By now, support from Renosa should have arrived.’

Although he was a member of the Black Wing Knights, he wasn’t one who fought against demonic beasts, nor did he serve the Grand Duke directly.

He was one of those who had fled in different directions to disperse attention.

In the process, he had been separated from his comrades. He was the only one among the five who had fled but hadn’t returned to the main force.

Being alone in this dense fog, in a mountain infested with beasts that tore his comrades apart, was an experience that incited extreme fear.

It was like being enveloped in complete darkness, unable to see an inch ahead.

It wasn’t that he had wanted this or fled to save his own life. It just happened this way.

The reason he couldn’t escape and return to the main force wasn’t because he was particularly cowardly.

Vis was mental strength. Being a Black Wing Knight, he had the strength to endure fear.

‘I just can’t gauge the direction at all.’

It wasn’t that the other four who returned had an exceptional sense of direction; it wasn’t that his was particularly poor.

He realized he wouldn’t be able to find the right direction in this fog.

If a beast tracked him, he might die a meaningless death. So he chose to hide.

He couldn’t stay like this forever, so now was the time to move.

The safety of the Grand Duke or his comrades was now beyond his control.

‘Is it this way?’

The day had dawned, and the fog had cleared a bit, so he could roughly guess the direction based on the sun’s position.

He moved swiftly.

However, unfortunately, his movements were soon detected.

“Grrrr.”

A low growl came from the darkness. The growl, filled with demonic energy, made his limbs break out in goosebumps.

It was a sensation he had never experienced as a member of the Black Wing Knights, who had always been in the position of the hunter.

Now, he was the prey, and the enemy was the hunter.

A cruel and swift hunter.

An overwhelmingly powerful enemy was targeting him.

What that meant was inevitable death.

Fear that could paralyze his heart surged up. Before fleeing, he had seen the beast’s hand piercing his comrade’s body. The hand, imbued with demonic energy, had even shattered a sword.

To face such a creature alone.

“Grrrrrr.”

The sound and presence drew nearer simultaneously. Whether from the tree or the ground, he couldn’t tell. It was just coming like the wind.

‘Damn it!’

He kicked the ground with his frozen legs. He couldn’t just die meekly like this. Absolutely not.

At that moment, what engulfed him was fear.

And the hunt began.



H.F.C Chapter 248 (Part 2):
				Around the same time, decisions were being made in the hideout where the Grand Duke had taken refuge.

“Be careful. We need to move while suppressing our presence as much as possible. If we catch that thing’s attention…”

“I know.”

“I hope nothing happens here either. We’ll block the entrance to the hideout as we leave.”

“We must inform the main force of the Grand Duke’s location.”

Small but solemn voices exchanged words. The Grand Duke’s condition was deteriorating.

The Grand Duke was also a swordsman who handled Vis. Thanks to his robust body, he was barely holding on, but otherwise, he would have been teetering on the brink of life and death.

If left unattended, he would become critically ill. He needed treatment.

They couldn’t just hold out in the cold mountains with meager supplies.

They had to move immediately, no matter what.

“If time passes and we don’t return, then…”

“I’ll either move alone or take His Highness. I’ll decide then.”

The one who was to stay behind answered cautiously.

The slowest one was to stay and guard the Grand Duke.

The other two would move in different directions towards the main force.

One was to stay behind to protect the Grand Duke.

Monsters were a problem, but there was also the possibility of other beasts sneaking in and harming the unconscious Grand Duke.

“Let’s go.”

It was a path of uncertain survival, but a necessary one.

The two who stood up left the hideout immediately.

In the now silent hideout, the one who stayed behind could only wait.

*

With every step, dense demonic energy could be felt.

It approached more densely than the now-thinned fog.

Helmut frowned.

‘This isn’t normal. No wonder seven Black Wing Knights were killed.’

It was hard to believe, but it seemed he might encounter a demonic beast capable of claiming its own territory even in the Forest of Roots.

It might not be on par with Elaga or Naho, but it was indeed a powerful beast.

‘They said it was close to a human form.’

Helmut had heard the survivor’s testimony before departing. About the beast that appeared out of nowhere.

It had a shape almost identical to a human, and its size was similar to that of a well-built adult male.

It was a puzzling fact.

Demonic energy enlarges the body. Strength fundamentally comes from weight and size.

Since demonic energy enhances that strength, the body, the source, also develops.

Both inside and outside the Forest of Roots, strong beasts were large. It was rare to find one that didn’t follow this rule.

‘Well, sometimes there might be small ones.’

Helmut shook his head. He didn’t know about all the demonic beasts in the Forest of Roots. But one thing was certain.

‘I can’t guarantee that it’s an opponent I can defeat.’

Helmut had never lost once in the human world. It was easy to think that he would naturally win.

Moreover, the opponent was a demonic beast. Slaying beasts was Helmut’s specialty.

But Helmut didn’t underestimate his opponent.

Both his reason and instincts told him of the enemy’s strength.

A sensation as if his skin was freezing. Tension rising spontaneously.

Even when facing the Palma Knights’ Commander, he hadn’t felt like this.

‘It’s been so long it’s almost unfamiliar.’

Helmut frowned. Even Helmut himself couldn’t guarantee victory if he were to face 15 Black Wing Knights.

But that beast had attacked the Grand Duke, killed seven, and driven the rest to flee.

According to testimony, its movements were very fast.

So when it suddenly appeared and attacked the Grand Duke, they couldn’t immediately block it.

‘Strong and fast too.’

He recalled past memories. When he took on an escort mission with the Pace Mercenary Corps through a beast-infested forest.

The leader monster there was quite strong too.

The strongest demonic beast Helmut had faced in the human world was the monkey beast he met there.

But even there, the demonic energy wasn’t this dense.

Despite the numerous beasts present there.

‘Whatever kind of beast it is, it’s leaving traces of demonic energy with every step.’

A demonic beast that naturally exudes demonic energy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

Although the Seed of Darkness had shrunk a bit after fighting the priests, Helmut had to avoid demonic energy.

Especially now, having met his mother.

His heart twitched somehow. The Seed of Darkness seemed to react to the demonic energy. Helmut was getting closer.

He just knew.

‘The smell of blood.’

Helmut reached for his sword. The sword drawn from his waist emitted a cool light.

It was a beast with explosive speed. It could attack at any moment. He couldn’t let his guard down.

The thick scent of blood wafted from afar.

Fresh blood, as if it had just been exposed to the air after piercing flesh.

It came almost within reach beyond the fog. Helmut’s senses had never been this keen before.

Helmut moved following his senses. Towards where the demonic energy was thickening.

Thanks to that, he found it properly. Something was there.

‘It’s the creature.’

If he couldn’t handle it alone, it would be right to mobilize troops.

Helmut now understood human combat methods. But at least he had to confirm its appearance.

‘Whether it’s the Grand Duke who’s dead, or a Black Wing Knight.’

If the smell of blood was this strong, there would be no use in rushing over.

Helmut walked at a pace that was neither slow nor fast. The fog was now distinctly thinner.

And finally, he saw something. The metallic smell of blood was overwhelming.

The creature, hunched over with its back turned, was unaware of Helmut.

Its back rose and fell continuously. Splat, splat. Blood spattered in the air.

Helmut soon confirmed a gruesome sight with his own eyes.

An ordinary human would have screamed and collapsed at the sight.

The creature was devouring a dismembered man’s body, bones and all.

At its feet lay half of a Black Wing Knight’s head. The other half, drenched in blood, still bore a vivid expression of terror.

He must have been murdered in utter horror. Unable to resist properly.



H.F.C Chapter 249 (Part 1):
				“Hey.”

At Helmut’s brief call, the creature’s movements came to an abrupt halt.

The sound of it ravenously devouring the corpse ceased completely.

Silence.

An eerie quietness settled.

Helmut silently observed the creature. It slowly turned its body. The moment stretched, feeling as slow as a snail’s crawl.

And in the next instant,

Boom! It felt as if his hand had been torn away. A barrier formed by Vis spread around his sword.

Nothing reached Helmut’s body, but blood and flesh scattered everywhere from the impact.

The creature had thrown the half-eaten corpse.

“Graaaah!”

As if to say, ‘How dare you interrupt my feast.’

Its eyes blazed fiercely with rage. Rough, panting breaths echoed.

Helmut frowned. He stood his ground, not dodging, to test the creature’s strength.

But its power was beyond his expectations.

No wonder it had been able to break through the Black Wing Knights and harm the Grand Duke.

With attacks at this speed, one might only realize after being hit.

‘This is an opponent I must use my full strength against from the start.’

Tension rose. Helmut sharply observed the creature.

Dark, cracked skin and swollen muscles. Blood-red eyes. Something like clothing draped around its waist.

The form couldn’t be called human, but the creature resembled a human more than expected.

Demonic beasts generally take on the form of some animal. An animal infused with demonic energy becomes a demonic beast.

So, what was this creature’s original form?

The question naturally arose, chilling his heart. An answer he didn’t want to consider surfaced within him.

As if confirming his suspicions, the creature shrugged its shoulders and cracked its neck, like a thug intimidating an opponent.

That gesture…

‘It can’t be.’

All the blood in his body went cold.

Helmut had seen beasts that resembled humans before. The monkey beast he had faced was like that.

But this was different.

The body size, movements, and the clothing it wore. Everything pointed to its original form.

‘A human.’

That word pierced his heart like a cold blade.

Boom! The creature didn’t give him time to think. A rock flew like a meteor and struck Helmut’s sword.

Even though he had drawn more Vis than before, the impact traveled past his grip and made his arm tingle.

It was undoubtedly a powerful demonic beast. One that would fit right into the Forest of Roots.

‘But I survived even in the Forest of Roots.’

There was no need to overthink. Just because it was a powerful beast didn’t mean it was unbeatable.

If the creature was strong, so was Helmut. Helmut raised his sword towards the creature.

The basic stance for unleashing the Sword Saint’s swordsmanship.

Now he knew the level of its attack power.

Knowing that, he could dodge next time. Blocking the creature’s strikes consumed a significant amount of Vis.

Seeing Helmut’s stance, the creature grinned widely.

After briefly looking around, it snapped a branch from a nearby tree.

As the thick branch passed through the creature’s hands, it was shaped into the form of a sword.

The creature pointed it at Helmut. That stance looked familiar.

‘Continental common swordsmanship.’

It felt like a nightmare becoming reality.

In an instant, the creature vanished from sight.

Its movements were so fast they blurred. Bang, crash, bang! It didn’t sound like branches and swords clashing.

Helmut parried half of the attacks and dodged the other half.

He intended to dodge all but couldn’t. It was impossible.

The creature’s attacks were so fast, it was as if they didn’t face air resistance.

With that much demonic energy in a human-sized body, its speed becomes explosively fast.

And one more thing.

Demonic beasts don’t use swordsmanship. But this creature did!

And at a very high level, thoroughly ingrained in its body!

‘As I thought.’

The attacks paused briefly. But Helmut couldn’t relax his guard.

Flexing his numb grip, Helmut had to admit.

This was once a human. Not an ordinary human.

Judging by its swordsmanship, it was a swordsman of considerable skill. One that wouldn’t have been easy to face even when it was human.

He couldn’t be sure if it had completely lost its sanity.

If it retained its intelligence merged with its vicious instincts, it was even more problematic.

It would have both the strengths of a human swordsman and a monster!

As the creature exuded demonic energy, the Seed of Darkness in Helmut’s heart wriggled. As if responding to the demonic energy.

No, it wasn’t demonic energy. It was recognizing a similar existence. The beast in front of him.

Yes, the creature had something similar to Helmut.

‘The Dark Seed.’



H.F.C Chapter 249 (Part 2):
				The realization was both chilling and numbing.

A human dominated by a dark seed, standing before him as a possible future for Helmut.

It was like staring into a terrifying mirror of the future.

Veins stood out on his pale hands. This was an opponent that was oppressive both physically and mentally.

The creature raised the corner of its mouth in a mocking smile at Helmut.

The malicious grin on its face would have terrified most people.

It was staring at the ashen Vis blooming from Helmut’s sword.

As if finally realizing what kind of being Helmut was.

The creature must have felt the Seed of Darkness within Helmut too.

But fortunately, the Seed of Darkness didn’t seem to recognize each other as comrades.

Demonic energy was a cruel and savage force. In the Forest of Roots, beasts constantly fought and devoured each other.

Even if peace was established by hierarchy, demonic beasts always sought to tear each other apart.

The Seed of Darkness was the essence of the instinct to kill. Even similar beings would annihilate each other.

Helmut’s Seed of Darkness stopped wriggling. As if it had never been uncooperative. This was a relief for Helmut.

‘Good. I don’t have to suppress the dark seed while fighting.’

The Seed of Darkness knew. If Helmut lost his life, his Seed of Darkness would also cease to exist.

A parasite couldn’t survive without its host.

After a moment, the attack resumed. The creature lightly tapped the ground and flew like an arrow.

It clearly showed Helmut what a human with a bloomed dark seed was like.

Why the temple regarded them as enemies and tried to kill them as babies. How ferocious and dangerous they were!

A powerful body, extensive combat experience, immense regenerative power, and the overwhelming demonic energy emanating from its entire being.

It was an opponent Helmut couldn’t claim superiority over in any aspect.

Had Helmut’s swordsmanship not been superior to the creature’s, even engaging it would have been impossible.

‘I’m grateful for the harsh training from Darien.’

Every nerve in his body was on edge. He couldn’t afford to let his guard down for a moment.

A single lapse could cost Helmut his life.

Meanwhile, the creature, with its monstrous body, had an absolute advantage.

Helmut’s strikes would hardly affect it.

The creature’s demonic energy protected its body from Helmut’s attacks, and even if it was wounded, it would quickly heal.

‘It needs to be a fatal blow.’

Aiming for the neck, head, or heart. Only targeting those areas could bring the creature down.

Since it was originally human, its vital points should be the same.

But the issue was piercing through the thick demonic energy enveloping its entire body and overcoming its rapid movements to strike it with his sword.

There wasn’t even a glimpse of an opening or gap. The creature appeared flawless.

And there was one more problem. Helmut’s sword was one he had bought in Ratona.

Helmut had never used Darien’s swordsmanship with that sword.

Of course. The sword was purchased for disguise, not for wielding the Sword Saint’s techniques.

The creature saw through this. Helmut’s flaw.

Bang, crack, shatter!

The sword in Helmut’s hand broke apart.

Fragments imbued with Vis scattered in all directions. Though he dodged them, one piece grazed Helmut’s cheek, drawing a line of blood.

The impact from the creature’s strike had been too much for the sword.

It was a sword purchased in Ratona. It was a decent sword, but not a legendary one.

Vis should have been evenly distributed to absorb the shock through the entire sword, but Helmut was too focused on using swordsmanship to pay attention to that.

‘No, it’s useless.’

Helmut soon thought differently. It would have shattered eventually anyway.

The sword couldn’t withstand Helmut’s Vis.

“Grrrr.”

The creature looked down at Helmut leisurely from a distance.

As if to say, ‘What can you fight with now that you don’t even have a sword?’

In the moment the sword shattered, the creature could have delivered a fatal blow to Helmut. He had been completely defenseless, losing his weapon.

But the creature didn’t. And now, it watched Helmut’s reaction, like a cat playing with a struggling mouse.

It was a humiliating moment, but Helmut instead found solace and steadied his mind.

‘It’s being arrogant.’

He had faced stronger foes and survived countless near-death experiences in the Forest of Roots.

There would come a time to make the creature pay for its arrogance and complacency. As long as he stayed alive.

Nothing was more important than that.

Although he didn’t have the leisure to change swords, Helmut didn’t miss the chance the creature gave him and drew a sword from under his cloak.

This time it was Darien’s sword. It fit his hand incomparably better than the previous one, as if melting into his grip.

He felt he could now take on the creature. With Darien’s sword, combined with his Vis, he could deliver a fatal blow.

He was also more accustomed to wielding Darien’s swordsmanship with this sword, so his chances had improved.

‘But I might not be able to do it alone.’

It wasn’t the time to let pride get in the way. He pondered whether he should join forces with the other humans, even if they wouldn’t be much help.

At the very least, they could distract this demonic beast.

This was a kind of dilemma Helmut had never faced since entering the human world.

The opponent was strong. So strong that he could imagine himself collapsing after exhausting all his Vis if he continued to fight like this. That image was surprisingly realistic.

Even if he could defeat the creature, there was no guarantee that Helmut himself would remain unscathed.



H.F.C Chapter 250 (Part 1):
				Would it have been easier if he was alone? He could have withdrawn without having to fight.

Even if he defeated the beast, Helmut couldn’t trust even Charlotte.

Was it reasonable to pour everything into such a situation?

He sorely missed Alea’s presence.

But Helmut had to ensure the safety of the Grand Duke and, before that, protect Charlotte.

‘The Black Wing Knights’ Commander would be helpful.’

Eventually, people would come if the fight continued. Alonso, the Black Wing Knights’ Commander, would be the first to rush in.

In this forest, the only enemy was the demonic beast in front of him.

‘I hope the others don’t notice its true identity.’

Various magical beasts live in this world. They mostly dwell in desolate places.

The types of magical beasts differ by region. People generally only knew that magical beasts were ferocious.

Only a few mages have studied magical beasts in detail.

‘So it should be fine even if a demonic beast that can use some swordsmanship appears.’

Just when he met his mother, a beast with the Dark Seed appeared.

A human consumed by the Dark Seed. If his mother learned of its existence, how would she look at Helmut?

Helmut gritted his teeth.

Would it have been better if he hadn’t been in Renosa?

No, without him, there would be no one to deal with the beast, and more people would be in danger.

The flow had already led Helmut here, and he had to do what he could.

The monster had stopped attacking and was staring into the distant forest.

It seemed to have lost interest in Helmut, its attention captured by something else.

The beast’s eyes narrowed.

Helmut soon realized why it reacted that way.

From beyond, he could sense a faint presence running through the forest.

Though not loudly, he could feel someone moving quickly through the forest.

An adult man, probably a knight.

And the monster had keener senses than Helmut.

“Grrrr.”

A low growl escaped its throat. And in the blink of an eye—

Wham! It leapt off the ground. It had changed targets.

‘Oh no.’

It was an unfortunate situation. Helmut had hoped someone would distract the beast, but not to the extent that it would completely change direction.

Helmut could have retreated here and rejoined the main force.

But if he did, that knight would surely die.

Helmut didn’t hesitate. The dead cannot be brought back to life. If that person was someone who must not die…

Helmut immediately leaped.

Tak, tadak, tak! The beast moved through the forest, leaping from tree to tree.

Its speed was unbelievable. Blood rushed hot through its body. Its prey was right there.

The knight it had tasted earlier was quite delicious. Firm, elastic meat brimming with Vis!

It was a shame it couldn’t properly enjoy the meal due to the interruption, but it could catch a new one.

Though an interesting opponent, there was no need to waste time with him. It was enough to find easier prey!

The corners of the demonic beast’s mouth rose vertically in a vicious grin.

The knight also realized the beast’s approach. How could he not? The existence of a demonic beast rushing towards him while exuding magical energy!

It wasn’t hiding its presence at all. Under equal conditions, a human couldn’t outrun a horse.

The knight ran in terror, but not fast enough to outpace the demonic beast.

The beast, flying through the forest, swung down at the knight’s back.

Whoosh! Something flew in and collided with the hand swinging down at incredible speed. Clang!

With that sound, the knight threw himself sideways.

The beast’s hand, momentarily thwarted, struck the empty ground. Crack!

“Grrrr.”

The beast turned its head toward the direction from which the object had flown. Its eyes were filled with rage.

Helmut stood there, holding a bow. Since even Helmut couldn’t outpace the beast, he had restrained it from a distance at the right moment.

Helmut tossed aside the bow without bothering to adjust it and immediately drew his sword.

He ran straight towards the beast. He was trying to close the distance while recapturing its attention.

The beast looked at the approaching Helmut as if he were an annoyance.

Unlike the others, this one wasn’t easy.



H.F.C Chapter 250 (Part 2):
				As Helmut drew near, the knight who had been holding his breath watching the situation began to move.

Rustle. The small sound made the beast’s gaze return to the knight.

“Kyaaang!”

It immediately lunged towards the knight. This time Helmut was able to intercept.

Helmut, activating his whole body with Vis, approached at high speed and plunged his sword into the demonic beast’s back.

Crack! The sound of a spine breaking was heard. The beast let out a horrible scream as it turned its body. Finally, he had landed a successful blow.

Helmut managed to pull out his sword and shouted at the frozen Black Wing Knight:

“Go, now!”

He must have been one of those escorting the Grand Duke. His appearance here alone meant he was likely going to the main force to seek help.

The Grand Duke was likely still alive. For now.

If he could be quickly rescued and secured, Helmut could decide whether to continue fighting this monster or withdraw.

“Who are you…!”

Bang! Without answering, Helmut met the beast’s attack with his sword.

“Kyaaang!”

The beast, seemingly enraged at being blocked, let out a fierce roar and swung its arm at Helmut.

That slight injury didn’t seem to have much effect on it.

The clash of magical energy and Vis created a powerful wave that spread in all directions.

The shockwave lashed at the trees and wind. It was like a scene of a storm hitting.

The Black Wing Knight flinched and stood up.

Without any hesitation about whether he should fight together, he quickly realized he wouldn’t be of much help here.

That unknown boy was strong and could handle the demonic beast.

The knight determined he would only be a burden.

He had to complete his mission. To report the Grand Duke’s whereabouts.

“Hold on a little longer, I’ll bring reinforcements!”

Shouting that, the knight gritted his teeth and ran. Helmut’s arduous battle resumed.

*

At that time, another knight who had taken a different path arrived at the main force.

Breathing a sigh of relief, he was immediately led to Charlotte and Alonso.

“Your Highness the Duchess. Knight Commander!”

“You are.”

The knight who reported on the Grand Duke’s location and current situation bowed his head. The two conversed, leaving him aside.

“Securing the Grand Duke’s safety is the priority, so it’s not wise to engage in a fight with that thing. If we send mages, they can use stealth magic to hide from the monster’s sight. We should dispatch mages. Using teleportation magic from that location to move the Grand Duke to safety would be best.”

As Black Wing Knights’ Commander Alonso suggested this, Charlotte nodded.

“That’s a good idea. Wouldn’t it be better if you went with them, Commander?”

“I must protect not only the Grand Duke but also you, Your Highness. The monster could appear here, and I can’t go there alone. Nor can we both leave this place empty. We need someone to command the troops.”

Charlotte agreed. She wanted to confirm the Grand Duke’s safety herself, but that could be done after moving him with teleportation magic.

Michael and her mother were there too.

There was one more thing Charlotte had to do now.

“I understand. But we can’t leave that monster be… It attacked the Grand Duke, killed Black Wing knights, and terrorized nearby residents.”

She knew it wouldn’t be easy to deal with such a creature.

It had killed no less than seven Black Wing knights.

But it wasn’t a situation where they could leave it alone either.

“We can’t keep such a large force away from the capital for long. Since we have a substantial force here, it would be best to eliminate the monster. But that boy called Helmut…”

Alonso furrowed his brow.

“There’s been no word of him at all. I don’t know what’s happened.”

He looked towards the misty forest and soon spoke again.

“I should go and see.”

*

It was a grueling battle. Even though he wielded Darien’s sword, it wasn’t some legendary weapon that would suddenly make a difficult opponent easy.

Many factors were unfavorable. It was fortunate that the Dark Seed wasn’t convulsing from sensing the magical energy.

‘It seems to want to survive too.’

Or perhaps it was slowly absorbing the magical energy, enjoying a feast after a long time.

The Dark Seed, once as small as a bean, was gradually swelling in size within Helmut’s heart.

‘I wonder if they’ve reached the main force by now.’

Fighting against a strong opponent isn’t a bad thing. Helmut sometimes enjoyed it.

Even when he charged at Darien, even when he charged at Elaga.

But even Helmut didn’t want to die right away fighting an opponent who was clearly stronger and likely to defeat him.

Helmut was rational above all. Those with the Seed of Darkness cling to life. Helmut wanted to live. His battles were premised on the possibility of victory.

‘Should I retreat?’

Helmut considered it once again.

When two swordsmen of similar ability fight, the outcome is determined by the total amount of Vis.

Although Helmut had an enormous amount of Vis for his age, it wasn’t at a level comparable to a demonic beast that had bloomed the Seed of Darkness.

The beast seemed to be growing stronger.

While Helmut was gradually getting exhausted, the beast seemed fine.

He had inflicted several wounds, but they didn’t seem to have much impact.

No, he could see with his own eyes that the wounds it had received were healing.

It was reabsorbing the magical energy it had spread throughout the mountain, making the forest’s energy its own.

It was absorbing magical energy through the fight, just like practicing Vis techniques.

That magical energy greatly aided its recovery.

‘What an enviable cycle.’

At this rate, it could fight indefinitely.

As long as the forest doesn’t wither and die. A feat possible only because it was a magical beast, not a human.

In any case, Helmut had to make a decision before his Vis ran out.

Escape wouldn’t be impossible. He was confident in his ability to conceal his presence.

And soon, unexpectedly, the tide of battle changed.



H.F.C Chapter 251 (Part 1):
				The surroundings were filled with traces of a fierce battle.

Cratered ground, fallen trees, and crushed grass. At the center of it all was an empty clearing, as if a meteor had struck.

It was created just moments ago.

Helmut was concentrating on the battle so intensely that his head ached.

His senses had certainly narrowed. There was no time to be aware of distant places. He had to conserve his strength and deal with the enemy in front of him.

‘Luckily, I haven’t made a single mistake.’

Had he made even one mistake, he wouldn’t be standing here now. Helmut would have become the creature’s meal.

Darien never allowed Helmut a single error.

He would smack Helmut’s head and shower him with criticism at the slightest mistake.

‘You fool! Are you going to give the enemy such an opening?’

The experience he had harshly learned from Darien was proving valuable even in this prolonged battle.

“Grrrr.”

The creature’s eyes glowed. It was thoroughly enraged.

Since the Seed of Darkness bloomed, the creature had never struggled like this.

It was a predator, and even as a human it had been close to a predator’s position.

Such a beast had no patience to drag out time against what looked like a mere little rat before its eyes.

The magical energy imbued in the wooden sword suddenly intensified. The creature had decided to unleash its power.

But unleashing power creates openings.

Regardless of swordsmanship or anything else, the creature charged violently while spewing magical energy.

The branch it held in its hand had transformed due to the magical energy, taking on a monstrous shape.

Boom! Crash! Every time the creature struck the ground where Helmut had stood, the power was immense.

Helmut couldn’t dare think of counterattacking. It was like a typhoon; counterattacking would just get him swept away.

‘I need to create some distance.’

The creature’s movements had slowed slightly due to the magical energy expulsion.

Helmut, who had been matching its insanely fast attacks until now, seized the opportunity.

‘Now!’

As Helmut sharply changed direction and leaped to the side.

Swoosh- Thud!

With a sharp sound, an arrow flew like lightning and lodged in the creature’s shoulder. The demonic beast clutched its shoulder and convulsed.

“Arghhhh!”

Several more arrows directly hit the creature’s bare body.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Surprisingly, the arrows were hurting the creature!

Black smoke rose from the creature’s body, writhing in pain.

“Fall back!”

A shout came from somewhere, prompting Helmut to move. A man in black armor stood in the distance.

And around him, Black Wing Knights and soldiers were lined up, aiming their arrows. Reinforcements had arrived.

The arrows flew without pause. Helmut dodged their paths and approached them.

“So that’s the creature.”

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander muttered, frowning as he saw Helmut approach.

“You look terrible.”

It was more a frank assessment than picking a fight. The Black Wing Knights’ commander spoke down to Helmut regardless of whether he was an honored guest or not.

In fact, it was Charlotte and the other Renosa family members who had treated Helmut especially well.

Since he hadn’t allowed even a single hit, Helmut’s condition was relatively intact.

But he couldn’t completely escape the shockwaves of the attacks, so his hair was a mess and his clothes were torn in several places.

Helmut coldly retorted:

“You sure took your time getting here.”

A battle of this scale should have been felt even from a distance, yet they moved sluggishly.

“We were able to locate the monster thanks to the knight you spared.”

His tone suggested praise, as if saying “well done.” Helmut glanced briefly towards the demonic beast.

It was crawling on the ground, being hit by the rain of arrows.

Smoke rose from its body as if it were burning. The creature must be feeling pain like being burned at the stake.

‘So the arrows are effective.’

For Helmut, who couldn’t even wound the creature with arrows imbued with Vis, it was a bit of a blow to his pride.

But those arrows weren’t effective against the beast for no reason. They must be no ordinary arrows.

Alonso explained:

“These are purification arrows made by the temple. They’re for hunting great magical beasts, kept in the treasure vault. I didn’t think we’d have a chance to use them.”

It seemed they hadn’t come unprepared for the subjugation. They had their own reliable means, and it was proving very effective.

The power of sacred energy was indeed remarkable, even in small quantities, against entities possessing magical energy.

Holy power was the natural enemy of magical energy. What couldn’t be achieved with vast amounts of Vis was being accomplished.



H.F.C Chapter 251 (Part 2):
				A brief, rapid exchange followed.

“That sword too?”

“It’s been imbued with holy power.”

Alonso had already drawn his sword. Helmut asked the most important question:

“The Grand Duke?”

“You should say ‘His Highness the Grand Duke.’ He’s safe. Since the monster is here.”

“Charlotte.”

“Her Highness the Duchess is safely positioned in the rear. You seem worried about your junior.”

“Not really.”

There was a sense of protective wariness in Alonso’s gaze, like an uncle wary of someone eyeing his beloved niece.

The suspicion that Helmut might like Charlotte was now tedious.

Hundreds of arrows were raining down. The soldiers kept firing without pause, as if intending to turn the beast to dust by exhausting all their arrows.

The demonic beast now lay sprawled, being hit by arrows without even making a sound. It seemed to be using all its magical energy to regenerate its body.

“What about the signal flare?”

“There was no time to take it out.”

There hadn’t even been a moment to fumble for the signal flare. He had been busy restraining and facing the creature.

First, deal with the annoying mosquito buzzing in front of you. The creature’s sole focus seemed to be attacking Helmut.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander spoke while keeping his gaze on the beast:

“I can see that you’re strong, but acting alone isn’t necessarily wise. Keep that in mind.”

“Then prove that you can be of help.”

An arrogant reply struck down. Helmut gave the Black Wing Knights’ Commander a cold stare.

This surely wasn’t the end. The creature’s magical energy was like an eternally burning flame.

Even holy power hadn’t damaged its core.

The Seed of Darkness. The blossomed dark seed was an infinite source of power.

Until it was completely destroyed, it could be restrained but not stopped entirely.

And then the rain of arrows ceased.

Although they had brought a considerable number of arrows, even the wealthy Renosa family didn’t have an unlimited supply of purification arrows.

Until this incident occurred, they had been free from attacks by magical beasts.

“It’s not moving.”

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander raised his hand. All the knights and soldiers stood alert, awaiting his instructions.

The monster was quiet. As if its breath had been cut off just like that.

The black smoke rising from the creature’s body persisted. And the arrows densely lodged in its body as well.

There was no point in forming an encirclement – it could easily break through.

For that reason, the troops were positioned in one place.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander slowly stepped forward. The sword in his hand, imbued with holy power, emitted a sharp light.

He intended to pierce the creature’s vital point with it. Undoubtedly that was his plan.

Helmut followed about a step behind. Someone of the Black Wing Knights’ Commander’s caliber should be able to deal with the creature’s attacks sufficiently.

However, when they had closed the distance somewhat, the creature’s body twitched.

Its body rose up as if lifted into the air.

A sudden eruption of magical energy from within. In an instant, the arrows densely lodged in its body melted away.

Ssshh!

Like a volcano ejecting steam, black smoke explosively gushed out in an instant. It was smoke carrying magical energy.

An enormous amount of smoke obscured the entire view like a fog, turning everything pitch black.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander and Helmut quickly held their breath and raised their Vis.

Even with their sight obscured, their senses were keen and alert.

The creature could attack taking advantage of the obscured view. Their nerves were taut with tension.

They stood still in place, waiting for the smoke to clear. As the wind blew and time passed, the smoke gradually dispersed.

And when their vision cleared, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“It’s gone?”

“Where on earth did it go…?”

The place where the creature had been was empty. No one had been attacked.

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander muttered:

“Did it escape?”

It had been hit by purification arrows and depleted its magical energy. In that state, with the number of enemies increasing as well. It would make sense to retreat if it felt disadvantaged.

Even an intelligent magical beast might do so, let alone the creature which had been human. It should have that much intelligence.

But Helmut didn’t agree with Alonso’s speculation.

Something felt off. An ominous premonition was rising. There was something they were missing.

Suddenly, his heart plummeted. In an instant, the blood in his fingertips went cold. He shuddered.

It was a sensation very similar to fear.

The moment a certain thought occurred to him, Helmut cried out involuntarily. His tone was uncharacteristically agitated:

“Charlotte!”

While fighting the creature, he had suspected it might possess some rationality. Since it could wield swordsmanship, it might be able to think somewhat like a human.

What if it had heard what Helmut said?

What if it had realized that Charlotte was Helmut’s weakness…

It was a mistake. Why had he asked where she was?

Helmut himself did not fear death.

Dying in battle was something a swordsman could always face. It was also the fate of one born with the Seed of Darkness to overcome.

Of course, Helmut desired battles he could win, and he had confidence in creating such battles.

But even so, he did not forget the fact that he was close to death. He had the courage to accept that.

But what if that death wasn’t his?

That was what he feared. A moment later, Helmut shouted again:

“Where’s Charlotte!”

The Black Wing Knights’ Commander gestured in a direction. His expression was also frozen.

Helmut’s feet struck the ground. No thoughts came to mind. He just ran with all his might in the direction where Charlotte was.

There was no time to worry about conserving Vis or not.

Charlotte must not die. He couldn’t let her die.

She was more than just a junior who admired and recognized him well.

She was his sister.

A blood relative he hadn’t even known existed.

She was his mother’s daughter.

He couldn’t let her die. Absolutely not.



H.F.C Chapter 252 (Part 1):
				The beast was running. Crushing and trampling the twigs and leaves that blocked its path.

It seemed to be running on the ground at the speed of a bird flying through the sky.

Its body, exuding black demonic energy like smoke, was red like newly formed flesh, but without a single wound.

Just moments ago, the holy power of the purification arrows had burned through its skin and seared the flesh beneath.

That pain, like being branded with a red-hot iron! The demonic energy had protected the beast’s heart, preventing a fatal wound, but it couldn’t shield it from the agony.

“Grrrr.”

The beast’s eyes rolled back.

Its murderous intent and rage amplified the demonic energy.

It wouldn’t be satisfied until it killed all the humans here and crunched their bones and flesh between its teeth.

That fierce hostility stimulated the Seed of Darkness.

The blooming Seed of Darkness was powerful, and the creature, having not suffered a fatal wound, was able to endure that brief yet intense pain.

Though the arrow’s wound didn’t leave a mark, the extreme resentment was deeply etched into the demonic beast.

It would kill them all!

However, the number of humans was great, and quite a few were formidable.

No matter how powerful the creature was, having the Seed of Darkness, it couldn’t face so many humans after being hit by the purification arrows.

But it couldn’t retreat just like this.

The image of the black-haired human boy flashed through its mind.

Despicable wretch!

It had been a one-on-one duel. The beast would have been the victor in that fight. That’s how it would have ended if given time.

But then the other humans ambushed it?

No matter. They would all pay for it!

A few words exchanged from a distance.

The fool had foolishly revealed his weakness, and even as the beast’s entire body burned from the purification arrows, it didn’t miss their conversation and movements.

Charlotte.

The demonic beast instinctively realized that was the human woman’s name.

The moment the rain of arrows ceased, the beast knew its time had come.

Spewing out demonic energy to obscure vision, the beast immediately sprang into action, searching for the owner of that name.

In the direction pointed out by the other human!

How could a mere human woman possibly withstand the demonic beast’s attack?

The boy would arrive too late, only to wail over the woman’s bisected corpse.

Hissss. The beast ran, emitting demonic energy.

The scenery before its eyes changed in an instant. Not even a four-legged beast could outrun this beast at this point.

The grass withered and died black wherever it passed. It climbed trees, leaped over soldiers, and rushed towards its target beyond.

Soon, the creature found her. A human girl standing with a worried expression, surrounded by soldiers.

Realizing immediately that this was ‘Charlotte’. The only woman there. Didn’t she resemble that boy closely?

The beast’s pupils dilated. A satisfied look.

Someone spotted the creature and shouted.

“It’s a demonic beast!”

“The demonic beast is coming this way!”

“Protect Her Highness the Duchess!”

To think the creature would appear here! Had the main force accompanying the Black Wing Knights’ Commander been completely annihilated?

Fear and despair clouded everyone’s faces. But all the soldiers here were elites.

There were none who tried to flee. Seeing these ephemeral beings raising their weapons, a sneer crossed the beast’s lips.

Thwack! With a light swing of the beast’s arm, soldiers were sent flying like sheets of paper.

Weapons didn’t even pierce its body. With each swing of its arm, one head was crushed, one torso pierced through.

Blood and flesh splattered. It was a crucible of terror.

The demonic beast roared in front of Charlotte.

“Raaaargh!”

Worthless and weak humans. Even those of Renosa’s noble bloodline were no different.

When it was human, even the strongest couldn’t escape the chains of social status.

But now, the beast could turn even those who had been far above it into mere livestock. Livestock to be slaughtered!

They would all meet the same fate.

Yet surprisingly, the young human woman before its eyes was staring at the beast with clear eyes.

Irritated by the human woman’s attitude, the beast licked its lips threateningly.

Charlotte couldn’t remain calm.

‘To think it came this far.’

She felt a tension as if all the blood in her body had frozen.

If Helmut and her master Alonso had fallen, Charlotte would not be able to escape death here unless a miracle occurred.

The demonic beast was vicious and strong. It was terrifying. How could one not be afraid?

However, what was even more frightening was to die trembling without doing anything.

Charlotte certainly did not take up the sword for that. That was the pride of Renosa. To fight in a manner befitting the Renosa bloodline.

Charlotte quietly watched the creature’s movements with her sword drawn.

With a concentration that wouldn’t miss even the rustling of a leaf. She knew this wasn’t an opponent she could defeat by attacking.

That’s why she waited. In the fighting style she was familiar with.

‘Counterattack.’

She had already experienced the fastest movements.

She had fought Helmut. Even Helmut couldn’t take her down in one strike.

The beast might be stronger than Helmut, but it couldn’t be faster than him.

And then the creature moved.



H.F.C Chapter 252 (Part 2):
				Momentarily tilting its head at Charlotte’s unusual reaction.

The beast had to finish her off and escape before the enemies realized its target and gave chase.

The beast’s blood-stained hand stretched out as fast as lightning.

Clang! The sword deflected the beast’s strike. Despite deflecting the attack, an immense shock spread throughout Charlotte’s body.

The demonic energy emanating from it was suffocating.

Charlotte instinctively threw herself to the side.

Boom! A hole appeared where she had been standing, as if dug with a shovel.

Seeing the black shadow looming over her, Charlotte reflexively raised her sword.

All the Vis she possessed gathered in her sword.

But it was useless.

Crack!

The sword in her hand shattered, and a massive hand struck her abdomen like a hammer.

Thud! Charlotte fell helplessly and rolled on the ground. She couldn’t even feel the pain. All strength drained from her body.

“Charlotte!”

Someone called out her name loudly. It was a familiar voice.

Charlotte looked in that direction with blurry eyes.

“I’m… oka…”

She lost consciousness before finishing her words. Blood soaked her abdomen.

‘I’m too late.’

Helmut stood protectively in front of Charlotte.

The creature smirked, licking the blood on its hand. As if saying, in the end, you lost.

A faint breathing sound could be heard from behind. Charlotte wasn’t dead yet. She could survive if treated quickly.

But this beast wouldn’t allow that to happen.

‘In that case…’

His heart was burning. A certain power surged from the very center of his heart, as if about to explode.

He would give it his all.

The moment that thought struck his mind, Helmut realized he hadn’t been giving his all.

Because the Seed of Darkness was part of his full strength. He always had to keep the Seed of Darkness in check.

But now, for the first time, it escaped his consciousness. The lock inside him was released.

Vis erupted from Helmut’s sword. It was a darker, ashen Vis than before.

Drawing on the power of the Seed of Darkness was frighteningly natural. Like a fish knowing how to swim.

Now it was a battle of instincts. He unleashes Darien’s swordsmanship with full power.

As his consciousness numbed, Helmut charged at the creature.

Bang, crash, boom!

Debris flew everywhere, and dust billowed.

It was no longer a human battle. But it was certainly different from before.

What defeats demonic energy is ultimately stronger demonic energy!

The beast’s demonic energy, weakened by holy power, no longer surpassed Helmut’s.

When the two clashed head-on,

Bang! With a tremendous noise, the beast’s body stiffened from the impact.

Seizing that moment, someone’s sword came flying in from behind.

The sword of Alonso, the Black Wing Knights’ Commander!

That sword, precisely targeting its back, sent sacred energy coursing through the beast’s blood vessels.

“Grrrr!”

Its body had already taken damage. The demonic energy wrapped around it like armor dispersed.

At that very moment, Helmut’s ashen sword pierced the beast’s heart.

Thud!

With a dull sound, black blood spurted. The beast’s movements ceased.

Helmut vividly felt what he had pierced.

The blooming Seed of Darkness.

That which had blossomed vibrantly even after being hit by purification arrows now shattered like glass.

Black demonic energy spread around like miasma flowing from a corpse.

Alonso quickly retreated from the creature. Helmut also stepped back, leaving his sword in place.

Thump. The beast, its heart pierced, fell to its knees.

The strength rapidly drained from its body, only its upper body remaining upright.

At that moment, the consciousness that had been dominated by the Seed of Darkness regained control for just an instant.

The beast’s eyes blinked. Focus returned to both eyes. That gaze fixed on Helmut. It was a piercing look, befitting a Platinum-rank mercenary.

“You too will eventually…”

Along with a sneer, the monster uttered a curse. Helmut seemed to understand the words it couldn’t finish.

‘Become like me!’

A moment later, the focus disappeared from the monster’s eyes. Its lifeless head drooped.

It was over.

The bloomed dark seed had perished, and the monster met its death like a stone statue.

Thud. Helmut collapsed to his knees. His palms hit the ground.

He could barely feel the rough texture of the soil, as if his senses were numb.

His heart ached as if about to burst. He felt dizzy.

The price of borrowing the forbidden power of the Seed of Darkness, due to his own lack of strength, was now crashing down on him.

Not even once had he considered that power as his own. Even in the moment it saved his life.

He had thought himself strong. That was true. Helmut had never met anyone this strong in the human world before.

But today, he met an enemy that made him realize his arrogance. Helmut felt painfully weak. He wasn’t strong enough yet.

Look at this state.

“Are you alright?” Alonso asked.

Helmut managed to ask in a strained voice.

“Is Charlotte… alive?”

“The soldiers gave her emergency treatment and moved her while you were fighting that thing. But you….”

A shallow sense of relief washed over him. He couldn’t hear what Alonso was saying. It seemed he had exhausted his stamina to the limit.

His consciousness was fading. Normally, Helmut would never lose consciousness in front of someone else.

But it couldn’t be helped.

Helmut collapsed completely.



H.F.C Chapter 253 (Part 1):
				Never in history had Renosa been pushed into such a crisis.

Seven Black Wing Knights were dead. And the Grand Duke and his daughter the Duchess were severely injured.

Fortunately, the most important people of the Renosa family did not die, and the situation seemed to be resolved without incident.

However, at that time, an unwelcome guest visited Ratona.

In preparation for any emergencies, a message had been sent to the temple.

The temple is always looking for opportunities to expand its influence.

That’s why even the imperial family, which is already somewhat influenced by the temple, doesn’t rashly seek the temple’s help.

Renosa’s affairs are handled by Renosa. That was the principle.

However, with such a powerful magical beast, there might be variables. If the newly dispatched forces were to be annihilated as well, then…

Therefore, Renosa naturally contacted the temple.

But no one expected that the two High Priests, who were originally supposed to visit Renosa but had disappeared without a trace, would immediately come to Ratona.

The one who greeted them was Margret, the Grand Duchess of Renosa.

Because she was the only one in a position to greet the High Priests.

“It’s been a very long time, Your Grace the Grand Duchess.”

It was known to the public that the High Priests of the temple were arrogant people who placed nothing above the gods, looking down even on royalty.

However, these two were among the more moderate of the High Priests.

But even if they were considered moderate, they were still High Priests.

Those who believed that divine rules were superior to human laws.

They could do anything. As long as it was the rule of the gods.

Although the Grand Duchess of Renosa had grown up with deep faith since childhood, she couldn’t wholly welcome them.

After all, she had clearly seen what they were capable of 15 years ago.

Margret calmly greeted them.

“High Priest Agato, High Priest Levina. Thank you for visiting us. Renosa will not forget the help you’ve provided in treating His Grace the Grand Duke and our Charlotte with your noble hands.”

The pair of High Priests, a man and a woman, both exuded a young and sacred aura, looking young enough to be considered youths. They had an appearance befitting High Priests.

Especially High Priest Levina, who exuded a gentle yet noble dignity that would suit being called a saint.

“I’m glad we could be of help. We were originally supposed to visit Ratona for the swordsmanship tournament, weren’t we?”

“Our schedule was disrupted, but we didn’t expect the cause of that disruption to be here in Renosa. We were completely off track.”
