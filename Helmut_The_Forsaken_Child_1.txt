H.F.C Chapter 260 (Part 2):

Sarah was an active child.

During the time of Naho’s human farm, she had lived quietly in the village, but after meeting Elaga and being able to move around, she lived enjoying her freedom.

Thanks to running around freely under Elaga’s protection, she wasn’t like a typical noble girl without a single muscle in her hands, but had slightly tanned skin and good physical strength.

She had the basics for learning swordsmanship. And in some ways, she was more determined than Helmut.

“Hey, look at my posture. Is it right? Should I do it like this?”

“Lift your right arm, just a pinky’s width.”

“Like this? Is this it?”

Although she chattered incessantly, Sarah was enthusiastic about learning swordsmanship.

She wasn’t like Helmut, who had awakened his intelligence early due to the influence of the Seed of Darkness, but she was quite smart and persistent. This was probably due to the influence of magical energy to some extent.

Even while suffering from muscle pain, she didn’t try to give up learning the sword.

It wasn’t because Sarah was a persistent girl, but for a very simple reason.

“It’s super fun!”

‘There’s not much else to do here anyway.’

There weren’t many games for an active child to enjoy here. And she had probably tried most of them before Helmut appeared.

Elaga seemed displeased that Sarah wasn’t making flower crowns for it lately, but wielding a sword seemed to suit Sarah’s aptitude better than that.

‘It’s optimal for training.’

In the sense that one can focus solely without being distracted by other things. It was the same for Helmut.

While taking care of Sarah, Helmut also focused on his own training, and he was gradually able to shake off his memories of the human world.

“Kyaa! Look at this.”

About three months after starting to learn the sword, Sarah exclaimed excitedly as she succeeded in cutting a tree in half.

Since there was a short sword among the ownerless swords that she could handle, albeit heavily, she had been training with a real sword from the beginning.

Helmut said in a nonchalant tone.

“Yeah.”

Then, after a moment, he briefly added.

“Well done.”

Still, he remembered enough of what he learned in the human world to know what to say in such situations.

Sarah showed a bright smile.

“Right? I’m good, aren’t I?”

Even for Helmut, who had attended the Greta Academy where only prodigies gather, Sarah’s achievement seemed decent.

‘Quite fast.’

First of all, the environment was good. The Forest of Roots is full of magical energy, which also means that the entire forest is full of vitality.

In the Forest of Roots, one can achieve progress faster than in any training ground in the outside world.

Sarah was in the early stages of beginning to accept Vis. Right now, she was at the level of wielding a sword with some strength, but gradually she would be able to imbue Vis into her sword.

‘That time might come sooner than expected.’

Although it wouldn’t be comparable to the speed of Helmut’s achievements.

“How’s Sarah? Is she not bothering Helmut too much?”

“It doesn’t matter.”

Susan often asked Helmut about Sarah. Although the time they spent talking wasn’t long, the initial aversion he felt while being with Susan and Sarah had diluted.

Helmut was gradually getting used to this mother and daughter.

*

“What will you do when you leave the Forest of Roots?”

Helmut asked Sarah one day. Like Helmut, Sarah had almost no memories left of the outside world.

No, Sarah disliked remembering itself. Perhaps because the situation in which she left was so shocking.

Sarah’s answer was simple.

“Umm, I’ll eat sweets. The food here is terrible…”

It was a truly trivial goal. She seemed to be feeling something similar to what Helmut had felt before.

Hadn’t he also felt like leaving the Forest of Roots after eating the food Darien made?

‘It’s better now than it was then.’

Because Susan makes fairly tasty human food.

A daughter of a noble family rarely has to enter the kitchen.

Yet, Susan was quite skilled in cooking. According to her, she learned from other women when she was living in the human farm before. Although she was the only one among those women who survived.

‘The human world…’

Helmut looked down at his hands. While teaching Sarah the sword, Helmut had also made progress.

Since he wasn’t taking classes at the academy, he could invest more time in the sword than he could outside.

And Helmut was feeling it. That he, who had taken up the sword again, was different from before. Of course, in a good way.

‘Is it because I faced death?’

He had met a truly strong enemy and fought against them. And he had rampaged through the Forest of Roots under the control of the Seed of Darkness.

Like steel that had been tempered, Helmut’s vessel had become harder and larger after going through two arduous experiences in a row.

When he looked back at his condition after recovering his Vis, he felt that his level as a swordsman had grown.

Now, Helmut had to fill that vessel.

‘But…’

A cool wind blows in his chest. He couldn’t completely shake off the helplessness seeping into a corner of his mind.

The past Helmut had a ball of fire burning inside him. There was something he wanted to pour all his energy into, even if it meant consuming himself. Life without that something was empty.

No matter how much he swung his sword and trained, there was an emptiness that couldn’t be filled.

Helmut thought. If he focused on what he could do, wouldn’t change come someday?

What he could do was the same as in the past. Getting stronger.

Swordsmen sometimes hit the limits of their talent. But the Seed of Darkness allows one to surpass the limits that a human would normally have. This applied to talent as well.

Helmut could become endlessly strong. Really, until he reached some unknown end.

‘Revenge.’

Helmut brushed past that word. Even though he felt the Seed of Darkness stirring in his chest for a moment.

A hot, bitter gust of wind followed like an aftershock.

‘It’s about living.’

Even if there was no hope or passion.

As long as he was alive, he had to keep living. That was what Helmut had to do.

Time flowed smoothly like a river, but quickly.



H.F.C Chapter 261 (Part 1): The path of four
				Around the start of the new year, Greta Academy, which had just gone through a busy period, was still in a state of confusion.

At the end of each year, those leaving and those coming to the academy naturally intersect.

Today was the turn of those departing. After the graduation ceremony, they leave one by one to find their own paths.

And here was one who was leaving.

A slender figure in a white robe, a garment typical of a mage, with a hood pulled over their head, walked briskly down the hallway. Their footsteps were light and almost inaudible.

The figure in the white robe, armed with a pass granted to only a few, easily stepped into the depths of the academy.

Knock knock. With a small sound, the door soon opened,

“Dean.”

A clear and distinct voice resonated. The middle-aged man sitting at the desk looked up at the other person.

He greeted without showing any emotion.

“Congratulations on your graduation, Alea. Now you can live as your true self.”

“Yes.”

A tingling thrill ran through her heart. The moment she had been waiting for arrived rather heavily.

Because the path ahead would be far from easy.

Alea pulled back her hood. Amethyst-like clear eyes appeared between strands of frost-colored hair.

Her finely crafted white face was beautiful without exception. A manifestation of flawless beauty.

It had long been difficult to pretend to be a man even with magic.

Now there was no need to pretend, so she had removed the magic.

And the one before her was someone who knew her true form.

“Time has flown by so quickly.”

The dean muttered in a voice tinged with lingering emotion.

It had been 6 years since he had semi-forcibly accepted her, Alea.

The girl with terrifying talent and fierce determination now stood tall as a full-fledged mage.

She was probably the closest to being called an archmage.

And it seemed not long before she would claim that title.

‘So this is what happens when innate genius is combined with effort. Perhaps for the next few hundred years, Greta Academy won’t see a more outstanding graduate than her.’

The dean himself had contributed to Alea being in this position. He was suddenly overcome with emotion.

No matter how important free thinking is for mages, the dean couldn’t be favorable towards Alea, who looked so much like her grandmother, Heike, who lived her life wielding others’ lives and disregarding laws and common sense.

Even though he was her guardian, the dean had always maintained a distance from her, adhering to a stiff and principled attitude.

But at this moment, even that boundary receded. Whatever her personality might be, Alea was an excellent mage. She was an outstanding student.

“If you wish, I can create a position for you at the academy.”

It was an offer the dean made after much deliberation.

Of course, Alea, a genius mage, was too exceptional to be contained in the small vessel that was Greta.

However, accepting her also meant accepting the risk of antagonizing the temple.

Alea calmly replied.

“I’ll think about that later. For now, I’d like to leave the academy. I’ve been here for 6 years.”

Greta Academy was a treasure trove of magical knowledge. Also, it was the optimal place to study magic while hiding oneself.

She had gained everything she could from this place. Now it was time to put her plans into action.

She had prepared for a long time. For something that must succeed, something with high risk, to ensure it doesn’t fail.

Concern clouded the dean’s expression.

“I had hoped you wouldn’t live a life like your grandmother, but you’re doing so in a different sense. I’ve heard about your research. Are you planning to go to the Forest of Roots?”

A life as dangerous as jumping into fire. Is that the kind of life she’s going to live? Alea’s talent surpassed Heike’s, but Heike only antagonized the temple after becoming an archmage.

‘Heike’s granddaughter. Also, given that child’s inclination, sooner or later, she’ll be declared a public enemy by the temple.’

At the young age of not even twenty. Isn’t it too early for that? It’s not impossible to cleanse her identity yet.

Alea answered clearly.

“I thought you might know.”

The dean’s eyes swept across every corner of the academy. Alea, too, didn’t think she could escape the dean’s gaze.

No matter how much of a genius she was, she couldn’t do everything alone.

To venture into an area where no one has set foot before, one needs the achievements or assistance of others.

Alea slowly approached professors in the magic department who would cooperate with her research and achieved results.

Of course, all these movements were read by the dean.

The dean spoke as if admonishing her.

“The Forest of Roots is a forbidden area. No mage has ever broken through that barrier. And inside that barrier is full of demonic beasts. Even if the temple doesn’t know about your research, it’s still dangerous. Mages didn’t have very advantageous combat abilities in the Great Demonic Beast War. Even you could die.”

“Doesn’t Greta Academy teach that giving up research because it’s dangerous goes against the spirit of a mage?”

“Don’t you think it’s reckless?”

“I’ve prepared so it won’t be reckless.”

What reflected in Alea’s eyes was confidence. She bowed her head towards the dean who seemed about to say something more.

“I came here to thank you for taking care of me. I appreciate everything you’ve done.”

It was an expression of will that no words could shake her resolve. The dean nodded reluctantly.

“May you achieve what you desire.”

Now his job was done.



H.F.C Chapter 261 (Part 2): The path of four
				‘Finally.’

As Alea left the dean’s office, she exhaled. Her heart was pounding.

She couldn’t measure the success rate. But now she had to go. Until now, it had been just a process to reduce the failure rate.

‘Yes, it’s a dangerous plan.’

A plan difficult to achieve alone. That’s why there were others needed for this plan.

Alea put on her hood and started walking. When she put on her bracelet, her appearance was disguised once again. As she hurried her steps, Alea sank into thought.

‘Will they really join me?’

A few years ago, Alea had shared her plan with them and gave them enough time to think about it.

Their thoughts might have changed during that time. After all, they have things to lose.

Would they risk their lives for a friendship built in such a short time?

Alea was skeptical, but what she was overlooking was that she too was risking her life in that short time.

While lost in thought, she approached the agreed meeting place. A quiet open space on one side of the academy.

“Hey, Alea!”

Someone waved from over there. A young man in a robe with a gentle face. He had a soft impression that could draw anyone’s favor.

Next to the young man, who looked too young to be called a man, stood a tall, handsome blonde youth with his arms crossed. He was glaring at her sideways.

“You’re late, by 3 minutes!”

Instead of responding to his nitpicking, Alea said with an expressionless face.

“You both came.”

‘They’re as foolish as I thought.’

Contrary to the dean’s thoughts, it wasn’t her who was reckless, but these two.

Alea knew exactly what she was trying to do and how to do it, but these two were just risking their lives for Alea’s plan.

And they had nothing to gain by joining Alea’s plan.

Rather, they were only taking on the risk of losing their lives. Yet they willingly came here.

‘How on earth do they trust me so much. Should I call it human…’

Although she had shown them evidence, Alea’s explanation was unfriendly, and she didn’t tell them everything, but they said they would gladly follow Alea. That was about 4 years ago.

But it seems their resolve hasn’t changed in those 4 years.

Alea looked at this touching scene with a slightly bewildered feeling.

The reason for bringing them in was simple.

‘They say even dog poop can be useful if you want to use it.’

A cynical smile flashed across her face.

Asuka, the top graduate of the Swordsmanship Department, and Sian, the second-best graduate of the Magic Department. Alea, who had been the top of the Magic Department for all 6 years, looked them over carefully.

Now grown into full adults, they had not only grown physically but also in skill.

They had spent their time at the academy honing their skills.

All of that was for this plan after graduation.

Because 4 years ago, on that day, Alea had said, “Your job is to become stronger.” Somehow, Alea had become like a leader.

‘They’ve become more useful than I expected.’

This should be enough to be helpful in the Forest of Roots.

“What, did you think we wouldn’t come?”

Alea didn’t answer, and Sian quickly changed the subject, cutting off Asuka who was about to lose his temper.

“Tell us what we’re going to do now.”

“Before that, there’s one more person coming.”

She had intentionally called them a bit later, but knowing their personality, they would have arrived early.

After a slight time delay, that person had just arrived. Asuka and Sian’s eyes widened as they confirmed who it was.

“You, you!”

“Why is she here?”

What appeared there was a girl with black hair, whose calm and neat appearance stood out.

Charlotte, the Duchess of Renosa, Helmut’s younger sister, and the top student of the 5th year in the Swordsmanship Department.

Now growing into an adult, she bowed to them with a stiff face.

“It’s nice to see you, seniors.”

“You haven’t even graduated from the academy yet, have you?”

“No, Asuka, that’s not the point. Before that, she is…”

Sian’s expression crumpled. Soon, what appeared in his eyes was anger.

“She’s from Renosa! How can she be here! Does this make sense?”

t was a fierce outburst Sian had never shown before. Charlotte’s eyes wavered. Alea shook her head.

“I didn’t find her. She came to me first.”

Asuka and Sian’s gazes fixed on Charlotte. While Sian’s eyes were burning, strangely, Asuka’s gaze was closer to calm.

Considering their personalities, it was completely opposite.

Alea began to explain. It was about four years ago, after the vacation when Helmut went missing in Ratona.

Alea was trying to understand what had happened in Ratona during the vacation and was about to contact Asuka and Sian.

Charlotte, who had suddenly become thin, came directly to Alea and asked for a conversation.

“I have something to say about Helmut.”

The audacity of the Renosa girl, who once again drove her own kin into danger.

At that moment, even Alea’s icy heart cracked. Alea had to try her hardest not to use attack magic on Charlotte out of rising anger.

Alea barely managed to calm her mind coolly.

‘Let’s hear what nonsense she has to say.’

Because it wasn’t time yet to reveal that she knew the truth.

Charlotte willingly confessed to Alea about the incident that had occurred in Ratona.

Until then, Alea hadn’t overlooked the possibility that Charlotte might be trying to test her.



H.F.C Chapter 262 (Part 1):

Alea asked with a cold face.

“So, why are you telling me this?”

“Senior Alea, you’ll be a genius who will leave your name in the history of Greta Academy. I’m a swordsman, and I don’t know how to break through the barrier of the Forest of Roots. But you’re different. And you’re… Senior Helmut’s friend. I thought Senior Alea could help me.”

A cynical smile flashed across Alea’s lips. It was ironic that one of the Renosa family members, who had betrayed Helmut, was now shamelessly asking for help by saying ‘You’re Helmut’s friend’.

“Help? What am I supposed to help with?”

Charlotte didn’t mince words.

“Going to the Forest of Roots and rescuing Senior Helmut from there. That’s my goal. Senior Alea, please help me.”

Alea couldn’t help but react to her directness.

“That’s nonsense—”

“Senior Alea, you’re wary of me. When I talked about what happened in Ratona, you didn’t seem surprised. It was as if you were hearing something you already knew.”

It seemed like she had hit the mark. Charlotte was also a member of the Renosa Grand Ducal family. She was raised as a ruler among the nobility. Her observational skills couldn’t be poor.

Alea didn’t waver. It was impossible for Alea to easily trust someone in the first place.

“My face is always like this. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear what you said. I feel bad for Helmut, but I don’t want to cause trouble with Renosa.”

Even if Helmut were to burn down the royal palace of Ratona, Alea would support him.

However, that was still far off, so she intended to keep quiet until then.

The dagger held in one’s heart is not to be shown carelessly.

‘I have to wait for the right time.’

Charlotte didn’t back down. Her face was still serious.

“Please help me. Researching the sacred barrier would be valuable for a mage too, wouldn’t it? I’ll provide the research funds.”

“I don’t need it. Neither your research funds nor your support.”

Alea noticed that Charlotte had come with the intention of persuading her, even if she didn’t have any ulterior motives. That subtly softened her heart.

However, Alea still spoke coldly.

“Even if I had the mind to save Helmut, how could I trust you?”

“Senior Alea, you have a close relationship with Senior Helmut. But he… is also my blood relative.”

“His blood relatives betrayed him. Why would you be any different?”

Determination glinted in Charlotte’s eyes. The emotion that formed that determination was complex. Sadness, anger, helplessness, betrayal…

But it was solid precisely because it wasn’t just one emotion.

“I couldn’t prevent something that shouldn’t have happened. Even though Senior Helmut saved my life. I need to repay that debt.”

“A life debt, huh.”

“If you won’t help me, I’ll find another way to do it.”

“Anyone can make pretty speeches.”

“Do I look like I’m lying to you?”

At that question, Alea stared at Charlotte.

Alea had rarely interacted with Charlotte. But since she was a close junior friend of Helmut’s, she had already investigated her.

Charlotte’s reputation was consistently good. A diligent and reliable model student.

During her year at the academy. In that time of about one year, which is short if short and long if long, Charlotte had consistently shown what kind of person she was.

She was a steady and consistent type of person. Therefore, even if she had some intention, she wasn’t the type to approach in this way.

Alea decided to drop a hint.

“If you want to talk about something, wait until you graduate from the academy. By then, I might become interested in the Forest of Roots. Don’t go around stirring things up and spreading rumors.”

Charlotte immediately understood the meaning of those words. But doubt appeared on her face.

“Wouldn’t that be too late…?”

“Helmut isn’t that weak. He survived there in the first place. So you, don’t think unnecessary thoughts and just focus on honing your swordsmanship. With your current skills, even if you go to the Forest of Roots, you’ll only be a hindrance.”

Charlotte’s body flinched at the possibility Alea hinted at.

She looked at Alea with wavering eyes.

“And don’t misunderstand. When that time comes, it won’t be me helping you, but you helping me.”

Alea turned her back after cutting off the conversation. That was their last conversation.

But for those few years, Alea consistently watched Charlotte.

Wondering if she might inform Renosa about her, or if her heart might change.

The latter wouldn’t have been a problem. Alea could just pretend she had lost interest in the Forest of Roots.

‘Nothing is as untrustworthy as the heart of a noble.’

But as Alea had seen, Charlotte didn’t change.

And one day, as Alea’s graduation approached, she unfailingly came to find Alea.

Finally today.



H.F.C Chapter 262 (Part 2):

When Alea finished her story, silence fell among the four for a moment.

Charlotte silently stared at the floor, and Asuka scratched his head vigorously.

Sian was the first to open his mouth.

“No matter what you say, Alea, I…”

Sian’s face was full of distrust. He might be a bit weak, but he’s not the type to betray others or use them in that way.

Also, he couldn’t tolerate repaying kindness with treachery. Even with the excuse of ‘possessing the Seed of Darkness.’

When Alea told them all the facts, it wasn’t the hot-tempered Asuka who was most indignant, but Sian, who usually calmed down quickly even when he got upset.

“Nobles separate emotions and thoughts. I don’t think Helmut was deceived by false affection. He’s not that naive. But they must have had to abandon him regardless. Charlotte, you are also Renosa’s blood. How can we trust you?”

The Renosa bloodline is rumored to be cold and strictly separate public and private matters.

Charlotte didn’t refute those words verbally. Instead, she placed her hand on the stone pillar next to her.

“A swordsman proves their will by cutting off their finger.”

Charlotte immediately drew her sword. The white blade reflected an eerie light in the air.

The moment that sword was about to plunge towards her hand, Clang!

Charlotte looked up in surprise at the person who had blocked her sword.

“Charlotte, what kind of girl acts so recklessly? What, cut off your finger? Why aren’t you guys stopping her?”

Everyone looked at Asuka at once. Uncharacteristically quiet until now, Asuka had drawn his sword like lightning to stop Charlotte’s.

“We can reattach it if you cut it off. And living without one finger isn’t a big deal.”

“Uh…”

Alea answered coldly and simply, while Sian opened his mouth and stuttered. He seemed momentarily intimidated by Charlotte’s intensity.

But Charlotte, who was actually embraced by Asuka, spoke with a hardened face.

“Senior, please don’t say things like ‘girl’. I am a swordsman.”

“Right, a swordsman. But how can you think of shedding blood here, it’s unsightly.”

Charlotte flinched at the word ‘unsightly’. She bit her lip before speaking.

“If fingers are the problem, I’ll cut my hair.”

This time Charlotte grabbed her hair. Asuka quickly reached out and grasped her wrist holding the sword.

“Hey, if you cut your hair you’ll look even uglier! You already look ugly next to Alea.”

Charlotte raised her eyebrows and glared at Asuka, who was restraining her with a horrified expression.

“Senior, don’t stop me. This is the only way I can prove myself, isn’t it?”

Asuka turned his gaze and gave Sian a look. Only then did Sian wave his hands and blurt out.

“No, it’s okay! You don’t need to do that. I understand.”

Unlike the cool-headed Alea and Asuka who used to beat up other students, Sian was among the most timid.

His heart had been pounding since they started talking about cutting fingers and whatnot.

“But you won’t be convinced otherwise…”

Charlotte’s words conveyed a firm will to join the plan to rescue Helmut. That’s why she was acting as if she absolutely had to gain the trust of her comrades.

Sian finally sighed.

“I’m not sure. Alea, since you decided to bring Charlotte along, I’ll go with your judgment.”

Sian glossed over it, thinking that smart Alea must have figured it out.

“Right, Charlotte will be a useful force in the Forest of Roots. One swordsman is too few. It’s not like we have someone we can hire without the secret leaking out. And too many people would be hard to control. Plus, there’s a safety measure.”

Alea extended her hand and scanned Charlotte’s entire body with magic. She was thinking of removing any tails if she had come with any.

“Charlotte won’t be able to contact Renosa at all from now on. In other words, Renosa won’t know whether Charlotte lives or dies. That should be enough, right?”

Alea concluded chillingly. In other words, it meant they could use Charlotte like a disposable item and throw her away.

Even if they killed Charlotte as part of their revenge, it couldn’t be helped.

But Charlotte accepted even the threat that Alea subtly implied.

“I don’t mind.”

“By the way, the same goes for you all. I told you to leave messages for your families, right? I’ll do my best, but there’s no guarantee we’ll all come back alive.”

Alea issued a warning with a cold face. As if to say, turn back now if you’re afraid.

However, Asuka just grinned, and Sian merely shrugged his shoulders.

“Yeah, when else would I get to see the Forest of Roots? Sounds fun.”

“I’m prepared. I didn’t know I’d be risking my life for a friend, but it’s loyal and good, isn’t it?”

Both responses were close to ‘not thinking much’.

“If Senior Helmut hadn’t saved me four years ago, I know my life would have ended. So I don’t mind if it’s just postponed.”

Only Charlotte was serious.

“Good.”

Alea looked around at those who had agreed to join her.

They had all honed their skills waiting for this day, but none of them were as desperate as Alea herself.

Her heart was pounding. Longing pierced deep from within.

She had never shared such emotions with anyone since birth.

The bond formed then hadn’t faded even after four years.

‘Finally, at last.’

I’m coming to meet you.

Alea closed her eyes for a moment.

And soon she opened her eyes again and declared.

“Then, we move.”

At that moment, Sian raised his hand.

“But one question, how are we going to get to the Forest of Roots?”



H.F.C Chapter 263 (Part 1):

Alea replied simply.

“We have someone who will help us.”

“Can we trust this person? This isn’t an ordinary situation.”

Sian wore a suspicious expression.

Going against the Temple was no small matter. It wouldn’t be easy for anyone to risk helping them, no matter who they were.

That’s why they had maintained perfect silence about Helmut’s disappearance until now.

There were many rumors about the handsome, genius second-year representative of the Swordsmanship Department who vanished after attending the academy for just one year.

But when asked, his friends only said they didn’t know anything either.

Who could they possibly tell?

That Helmut was the heir to the Renosa duchy and possessed the “Seed of Darkness”. That he was abandoned in the Forest of Roots and he was exiled again even after surviving and returning.

Trust was meaningless. No one could be trusted completely.

So you just need to choose someone who can’t betray you, or has no reason to betray you.

Alea was faithful to that logic.

‘It’s impossible for me alone to break through a sacred barrier that even the greatest archmages couldn’t breach in such a short time.’

No matter how much of a genius she was, the world of magic was vast and Alea was still young. She coolly assessed her own limitations.

Going to the Forest of Roots was impossible on her own strength alone. Even Heike was reluctant to do it.

So Alea looked for another way. If she couldn’t do it herself, she just needed to find someone who could.

*

The person to ask about such a someone was obviously Heike. Heike provided an answer to Alea’s question.

‘There is an archmage who researches the sacred barrier of the Forest of Roots. But, well, I’m not in contact with him… Actually, he really dislikes me. He says I’ve tarnished the name of archmages or something.’

‘I see. Who is this archmage?’

‘Antiol.’

It was a name she had heard before.

No, he was very famous.

A master of barrier magic.

Archmage Antiol helped various countries transition away from the Temple by replacing holy power with magic.

The influence of the overbearing Temple was already declining day by day, as the human world had long been free from the threat of demonic beasts.

In such circumstances, it was clear how much the Temple must be grinding their teeth at Antiol.

‘He’s already burned his bridges with the Temple, so he’ll do anything the Temple dislikes.’

‘He’ll be reminded of you when he sees me. Will he really cooperate so easily?’

That’s for you to figure out. But you’re different from me, and he’s not petty enough to dislike you just because of me. If you pique his interest, Antiol will help you.’

Heike spoke with certainty. Mages are a curious breed. Archmages even more so.

But the problem was how to contact this Antiol.

‘I’ve heard Antiol has secret connections with other mages. There’s supposedly someone linked to him at every academy. There’s likely a professor who’s in contact with him.’

Alea had an accurate grasp of each magic department professor’s inclinations.

From those friendly to the Temple to those who disliked it.

The one with the most flexible mind and strong curiosity, likely to have connections with the archmage who became an enemy of the temple.

‘Professor Luxen.’

Was there a need to reveal the whole truth? Even if Professor Luxen, who had gone with them to Renosa, had suspicions about Helmut, Alea had no intention of involving him.

Alea approached Professor Luxen and let him know she was interested in Archmage Antiol’s field of research.

Professor Luxen shrewdly sized her up, then informed Archmage Antiol of her existence, and that’s how the meeting was arranged.

‘So you’re Alea. You’re the spitting image of Heike. But your personality seems quite different. I’ve heard about you. Luxen praised you as the greatest genius in Greta Academy’s history.’

‘Not just Greta Academy.’

Antiol chuckled at Alea’s confidence.

‘You seem to take after your grandmother in that regard. So, you’re interested in my research?’

‘Yes, actually…’

Unlike with Professor Luxen, Alea revealed part of the truth to Antiol.

Her friend had been exiled to the Forest of Roots, and though his fate was unknown, she wanted to rescue him. She wanted to know about the Forest of Roots and the sacred barrier.

In front of an archmage, shallow tricks wouldn’t work. Trying to get what she wanted with vague words was nearly impossible.

So she laid her cards on the table, hoping for his cooperation.

‘I’d like your help. I will bring your research to fruition.’

Alea spoke politely. The one in need was clearly her side. But Antiol showed an unexpected reaction.

‘Helmut, you say. That reminds me of a boy I once met. Is this Helmut a sword-wielding boy with black hair and black eyes?’

Alea’s eyes widened. Helmut had never mentioned Antiol to her.

It wasn’t that he deliberately hid it, but given his taciturn nature, it had naturally been omitted.

‘That’s right, but…’

‘I had a connection with him once. So he went to Greta Academy.’

Antiol muttered, then his eyes flashed sharply.

‘There’s something you haven’t told me.’

That Helmut possessed the Seed of Darkness.



H.F.C Chapter 263 (Part 2):

Rescuing a boy exiled to the Forest of Roots was vastly different from extracting a bearer of the Seed of Darkness.

‘Is he still controlling his Dark Seed well?’

‘I’ve never seen any sign of it going out of control. He manages himself perfectly. Even when facing another bearer of the Seed of Darkness.’

Alea told him about what had happened to Helmut.

It was a story that could evoke sympathy even in Archmage Antiol, who had grown numb to most things after living so long.

Antiol clicked his tongue with a complicated expression.

‘I never imagined there was someone who escaped from the Forest of Roots. If I had known who he was looking for earlier, I would have told him. Nobles are utterly untrustworthy creatures. Especially the Renosa bloodline is ruthlessly cruel.’

‘What’s done is done.’

A look of concern crossed Antiol’s face.

‘But me helping you is a different matter. Of course, what happened to him is utterly tragic, but for the sake of the world, it might be better for that child to remain in the Forest of Roots. If a swordsman of his caliber awakens the Seed of Darkness and goes berserk, it would be no ordinary disaster. Countless lives could be lost.’

Alea shook her head. Her voice flowed out clearly and deliberately.

‘For the sake of the world. Small sacrifices are unavoidable for the greater good. That is the justice the Temple espouses. I was under the impression that you, Archmage Antiol, did not agree with such Temple doctrines.’

‘That is…’

‘Helmut is innocent, and was exiled to the Forest of Roots solely for possessing the Seed of Darkness. Those who return from exile to the Forest of Roots are forgiven of all crimes. But he was not even allowed that rule because he possessed the Seed of Darkness. He never committed any crime in the first place. Is what happened to Helmut just?’

‘It’s not just. But for nobles, their family has the right to decide the fate of its members.’

‘Helmut is not the official heir to Renosa. He never enjoyed any of the wealth or honor Renosa could offer. He was just a young boy trying to remember and find the mother who gave birth to him. But his mother abandoned him twice.’

A moment of silence followed.

Antiol’s brow furrowed.

Though he was an archmage who had lived realizing his desires, he could not easily participate in something that might bring calamity to the world.

But he did not deliberate for long.

‘…Your attempt to appeal to my sympathy was quite useful. Alright, I’ll help you. Perhaps my meeting him back then was my fate as a mage. In the end, perhaps it was meant to come to this.’

‘Thank you.’

‘No need for thanks. You may have moved my heart, but it was my decision to comply.’

With that, it was settled for now.

With Antiol’s help, Alea was able to make plans up until today.

*

As Alea’s story came to an end, everyone wore dazed expressions.

Asuka raised an incredulous look.

“Archmage Heike and Antiol, wow, real heavyweights just keep popping up.”

Sian chimed in.

“I feel like I just heard some incredible story.”

“Let me be clear, they won’t be coming with us to the Forest of Roots. We don’t know what will happen in there.”

“Well, we’ll just have to trust in the great Alea!”

“You do what you want. We’ll just follow orders when we get there.”

Are there such reckless fools?

Alea looked at them with exactly that kind of gaze. They had faith that the clever Alea wouldn’t head into danger without any plan.

Of course, there was a high possibility that if danger arose, Alea would try to save only herself.

Charlotte, who had come to her senses belatedly, opened her mouth.

“Then is Senior Alea a blood relative of Archmage Heike? I suppose your amazing talent was inherited from her.”

Alea frowned slightly. She was not keen on being associated with Heike in any way.

“Perhaps.”

Asuka and Sian noisily chattered beside her.

“That’s right, we didn’t know either!”

“We’ve been friends for years and we still didn’t know that!”

“Who said we’re friends?”

Alea snorted. She had spent time with them occasionally since Helmut disappeared, but that was just out of habit, not because she particularly thought of them as friends.

There was also the calculation that she needed to build some semblance of friendship to go together to the deadly Forest of Roots.

Alea immediately declared with a serious face.

“That’s all for the explanation. We’re going to meet Archmage Antiol right away.”

“Teleportation magic?”

“No.”

Alea took something out from her chest. It was a reddish gem. Inside was engraved a small oval.

As soon as Alea infused it with magical power, light spread outward from the gem.

That light expanded the oval inside the gem and drew it in mid-air. It was an entrance large enough for one man to stand and enter.

The scenery inside the oval shimmered hazily. As if a window to another world had been opened.

“This is a door leading to his residence.”

“This is amazing.”

“It feels like we’re being invited into a myth.”

Sian and Asuka exchanged comments. Both looked excited.

Alea approached the door first.

“Follow right after me.”

Asuka, Sian, and Charlotte quickly drew near. Asuka glanced at Charlotte and said as if just remembering:

“Oh, but going to the Forest of Roots is fine and all, but it’ll be uncomfortable for Charlotte. Being among all guys.”

Sian replied flatly.

“There won’t be any problem as long as you don’t do anything weird.”

“What weird things would I do! Don’t paint me as some pervert!”

“I’ll be fine. It was like that in the Swordsmanship Department too.”

Listening to their conversation, Alea realized there was still something she hadn’t told them.

Tilting her head slightly, Alea said nonchalantly:

“I’m a woman too.”

And she immediately stepped inside the door.

Just after her figure disappeared beyond the oval, chaos swept over the group.



H.F.C Chapter 264 (Part 1):

“You’re a woman? Impossible!”

Although they had entered through the door, everyone was frozen in shock, unable to take in their surroundings. Asuka shouted accusingly, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Alea, who had been standing quietly, snorted.

“Shall I prove it to you?”

Alea moved, casually removing her bracelet.

In an instant, the magic dissipated, revealing her true appearance.

The subtle effects that had made her appear male were gone.

Now standing there was a beautiful woman with silver hair and violet eyes.

A woman’s appearance, unfamiliar even to herself. Having lived in disguise for so long, Alea felt strange standing before others as a woman.

And as unfamiliar as she felt, so did the others.

No, it was downright shocking.

“This can’t be. It’s impossible…”

Asuka wore an expression of wanting to deny reality.

For some reason, it seemed that to him, Alea was a being who could never be a woman.

Sian, who had been stunned for a moment, finally came to his senses and muttered.

“I see, so that’s how it was. I thought something was odd. You two were always together. Then, you and Helmut…”

Alea raised an eyebrow without answering. Charlotte, with a somewhat complicated expression, spoke up.

“So that’s why Senior Alea was so proactive.”

So for her, Alea would be her brother’s girlfriend. It was a completely different feeling from just being a close friend.

Asuka and Sian looked at each other and exchanged words.

“I thought she was too pretty for a guy. But why didn’t we notice at all? You didn’t know either?”

“I didn’t. I might have vaguely suspected at some point, but you know her personality…”

Alea was arrogant, distant from everyone, and her manner of speech was extremely rigid.

Her strong and solitary demeanor, which had no hint of femininity except for her appearance, eliminated any chance of suspicion taking root.

“So that bastard Helmut was secretly dating in the academy without us knowing? What a deceiver. Pretending not to have a girlfriend!”

“They even shared the same room! This is reportable! Co-ed living in the academy dormitory!”

“You’re receiving support from the Dean. How… Wait, is the Dean an accomplice? Surely he couldn’t have been unaware?”

“Hiding it until graduation, what a tough woman!”

“It feels weird to refer to Alea as a woman. It gives me goosebumps.”

Sian frowned and shook his head vigorously.

“Alea, when and how did you start dating Helmut?”

“Were you two going on dates while sticking so close together?”

Alea responded indifferently to their interrogation.

“That’s not what’s important right now.”

“But Alea, you’re unexpectedly romantic?”

“Risking death to save your boyfriend. Isn’t this pure love? Pure love.”

Asuka, who had spoken teasingly, felt the cold gaze directed at him and flinched, closing his mouth.

Somehow, Alea as a woman seemed even scarier than Alea as a boy.

“Enough chatter.”

The group fell silent as if under a silencing spell. Even while chattering, they had been steadily walking.

The place they arrived at after passing through the door was a path with forests stretching out on both sides, and all they had to do was follow that path.

The shock of learning that Alea was a woman had prevented them from noticing anything else.

And at the end of the path, an old man was waiting for them.

Antiol, with his long white beard and monocle, emanated an indescribable aura.

Because of this, everyone recognized his identity as soon as they saw him.

‘Archmage Antiol.’

A man famous enough that any decent mage would have heard of him.

While archmages were capable of maintaining a youthful appearance, he seemed to have fully embraced the passage of time.

Alea bowed her head in greeting to him.

“Lord Antiol.”

“I heard some commotion earlier. Seems there was some issue.”

“It’s nothing. I’ve brought everyone. We’re ready to depart.”

“He really looks like an archmage,” Sian whispered into Asuka’s ear from the side.

“Yes, and you look like a spirit mage. A rare talent.”

Despite the low voice, Antiol pointed it out precisely, making Sian flinch.



H.F.C Chapter 264 (Part 2):

Antiol observed them with a smile, as if examining them.

“To have four such promising young people risking their lives on this journey. It seems that fellow didn’t live in vain. And you, are you of his bloodline? You look very much alike.”

“Yes, that’s right.”

“From what I can see, it looks like the Renosa bloodline. Are you a defector from the family? Or…?”

Antiol’s eyes shone sharply. Charlotte spoke firmly.

“I’m just doing what I believe is right. I have something I must return to him.”

“What you believe is right… That’s a youthful thing to say. But the world isn’t that simple. When the time comes to make a choice, what will you do then?”

Antiol’s question was sharp. It was a difficult question asking whether she would choose her family or Helmut.

Before Charlotte could answer, Alea interjected.

“We are prepared.”

After all, Charlotte’s value lay in being a useful force in the Forest of Roots.

Even if she were to turn her back after rescuing Helmut, it wouldn’t be an immediate problem, so there was no need to complicate things prematurely.

Antiol’s gaze returned to Alea.

“Did Heike agree?”

“It’s my choice. There won’t be a problem.”

Alea’s words were no less resolute than Charlotte’s.

Of course, Heike didn’t agree readily. But the reason for her disagreement was different.

‘Good heavens! My granddaughter risking her life for a mere boy! Half the world is men, what on earth is so special about that guy.’

However, despite her initial incredulity, Heike came to terms with it using her own logic before Alea could say anything.

‘Well, that fellow was exceptionally handsome. Such men are rare.’

‘…’

In any case, Heike decided to cooperate with Alea, reasoning that it would be worth it if she could see a handsome grandson-in-law.

Only, she said she wouldn’t accompany Alea.

No matter what preparations were made, heading to the Forest of Roots was a dangerous adventure.

Because of this, Alea didn’t expect that much from her either.

Antiol nodded.

“Well, alright. If Heike hadn’t permitted it, she wouldn’t have let you come this far. I too have finished my preparations.”

“Um, I have a question,” Sian quickly raised his hand. His manner of asking questions like a model student seemed quite familiar.

“Why are we here? Alea didn’t tell us anything about it.”

Sian subtly pointed out Alea’s unfriendliness. At this rate, it seemed they would be swept along without knowing what they were doing.

Antiol stroked his beard.

“Right, I should explain. How much do you know about the Forest of Roots?”

Sian and Charlotte shared the knowledge they had gathered about the Forest of Roots.

Naturally, Asuka just watched blankly as they talked, knowing nothing. He had been solely focused on honing his sword skills all this time.

“It seems you’ve picked up as much as is commonly known. As you know, no one who has entered the Forest of Roots has ever come out. Except for that boy, Helmut, previously.”

“Then how do we enter the Forest of Roots? Can we just walk in?” Sian asked curiously.

The Forest of Roots is a place you can’t leave once you enter. Because of this, no one tries to enter.

So there was no information on whether entering was possible without any hindrance.

There was no treasure hidden in the Forest of Roots, and no one was willing to risk their life trying to enter a place teeming with demonic beasts.

“I’ll explain it simply. First, the sacred barrier is a boundary. A boundary that separates the inside from the outside. Separation means division. In other words, the sacred barrier prevents both coming out from the inside and going in from the outside. Of course, the latter is much easier than the former.”

“So you mean it’s not easy to enter either?”

“Yes, it might actually be easier for an ordinary person with no power in their body. Holy power and demonic energy are incompatible. To a lesser extent, holy power also repels other powers. Magic power, then Vis, in that order. The resistance to magic power is quite strong, while the resistance to Vis isn’t that great. However, the greater the power one possesses, the stronger the sacred barrier’s resistance becomes, so the power consumption increases.”

“Then when we cross the sacred barrier and enter the Forest of Roots, sword users would be in better condition than mages, right?”

Antiol nodded.

“Here’s where the problem lies. According to my research, the sacred barrier acts differently when exiting and entering. When exiting, it’s particularly sensitive to demonic energy, not allowing even a little demonic energy to leak out of the barrier. In exchange, it’s relatively less sensitive to other powers, but when entering, the resistance to other powers is quite significant.”

“How challenging?”

“Right after you enter the Forest of Roots, mages might not even have the strength to stand. Sword users would be in a better situation, but entering in such a depleted state is risky in itself.”

“How did Helmut, who was sent to the Forest of Roots, overcome this resistance? He has both Vis and demonic energy… Ah!”

Sian exclaimed as if he had realized something.

“Yes, the only ones who can pass through the barrier without any loss of power while possessing power are those who can use holy power. In other words, sacred magic. All those who have been sent to the Forest of Roots so far were sent through sacred magic. Sacred magic allows even those with demonic energy to pass through the sacred barrier without any problem.”

“Then if we kidnap a priest and make them get Helmut out?”

Sian’s eyes sparkled as he suggested something dangerous.

“That’s only for entering. As I said, the sacred barrier acts differently when entering and exiting. The barrier doesn’t allow those with demonic energy to escape even through sacred magic. And to begin with, sending someone to the Forest of Roots through sacred magic requires the mobilization of many priests or a high priest. Are you suggesting kidnapping a high priest?”

Sian scratched his cheek.

“That would be… difficult, right?”

“The Forest of Roots is an extremely dangerous place. Formidable demonic beasts might be lurking near the barrier. Only strong ones would be able to suppress the instinctive pressure felt from the sacred barrier. Entering the Forest of Roots after consuming a lot of power carries too much risk.”

After pouring out his words, Antiol opened his mouth confidently after a moment.

“That’s why I’ve devised a method.”



H.F.C Chapter 265 (Part 1):

“What is that?”

“We will use holy power to enter the Forest of Roots.”

Sian looked at Antiol with curiosity.

“What? I thought you said we shouldn’t kidnap priests.”

“That’s right, but there’s no law saying we need priests to use holy power. Think creatively.”

A shiver ran through them.

“You mean…”

Antiol nodded slightly.

“We implement sacred magic to go to the Forest of Roots using magic. That’s the method I’ve come up with.”

Smiling, Antiol explained his theory.

“What I primarily researched was extracting and gathering holy power. I collected items from temples, herbs grown in temples, and extracted holy power from them.”

The Butan Trading Company had helped with this. Helmut had once escorted goods destined for Antiol during his brief mercenary career.

That’s when Helmut and Antiol first met.

It was truly ironic that the items Helmut escorted would be used to save him.

“To put it simply, we read the earth’s memory to mimic and construct Ratona’s sacred magic circle that banished Helmut, and implement the magic using the extracted holy power. The intermediate process is accomplished through magic.

I’ve already successfully completed the experiments. Although I don’t know what happened to the test subjects after they moved to the Forest of Roots.”

One wonders what he used as test subjects.

It was somehow a frightening thought.

Antiol spoke with a slightly excited voice.

“As a result, you’ll enter the Forest of Roots in a similar way to how Helmut was banished by sacred magic.”

Alea quickly added an explanation.

“I can guarantee the entry itself will be successful. I’ll also help stabilize the magic implementation within the magic circle. Antiol can’t come with us. He needs to operate the magic circle. The four of us are the entire party.”

Antiol looked at Sian with interest and said,

“The Forest of Roots is still a forest. The presence of a spirit mage will be very helpful in hiding you from the eyes of demonic beasts. Especially if it’s a dark spirit.

Two skilled swordsmen and two mages. An efficient combination. Not too many in number, so you’ll attract less attention. If you work well together, you should be able to overcome the dangers.”

Alea turned to look at the group and said,

“I don’t know what will happen in the Forest of Roots. I’ve heard some things from Helmut, but not in detail.

What’s certain is that the entire environment of the Forest of Roots will be hostile to us. We can’t let our guard down, not even for a single blade of grass or insect. demonic energy transforms all living things. The demonic beasts there see humans as delicious prey. Weak and tasty pieces of meat. Because of that, they’ll constantly target us, and it’ll be a harsh journey.”

A gleam appeared in her purple eyes.

“So, for the last time, I’ll ask again. Are you ready to go to the Forest of Roots?”

Their answers quickly came out to that question.

“Of course.”

“Absolutely.”

“Yes.”

It wasn’t just for friendship or repaying a debt.

It’s rare to find people willing to risk their lives for something. Whatever the reasons, they were all now walking into a deadly situation together.

Either they all die, none of them die, or some of them die.

However, all four hoped for the second case. And that ‘none’ included Helmut, whose fate in the Forest of Roots was unknown.

Antiol proposed,

“I’ve prepared a feast for you who are about to embark on a difficult journey. Come in.”

Somehow, Antiol’s residence had a lavish feast prepared as if in a noble’s mansion.

The food tasted good, but due to tension, it hardly went down their throats. They were just eating to fill their stomachs.

Sian grumbled.

“Somehow, it feels like a feast served to death row inmates. It’s the least appetizing meal I’ve ever had in my life.”

And Antiol caught that small voice with uncanny precision. He smiled and snapped his fingers.

Flap. Papers fell from the air in front of each of them.

“Death row inmates, you say. Here, write your last will and testament before you go. If there’s no news from you, I’ll deliver them to your parents. Write down the recipient too.”

Everyone wrote their wills with gloomy expressions. Asuka nudged Sian’s side.

“Hey, did you tell your parents?”

Asuka knew that Sian had grown up in a harmonious family.

On the other hand, Sian didn’t know much about Asuka, but he knew that Asuka’s family history wasn’t smooth.

“Would my family allow it? I didn’t say much. Anyway, I’ve been living away from home because of academy life, so they probably won’t even notice my absence. Sending me to the academy was like sending a child far away.”

Sian spoke indifferently.

“What about you?”

“Well, even if I told them…”

Asuka trailed off. Although Asuka could never be called a filial child, he did feel a bit concerned about his mother, if not his father.

“…I told them I’d travel around for a while after graduation before going.”

“Well, I guess that’s enough.”

They both glanced at Charlotte for a moment, then turned back to their wills. It was because they remembered who her parents were.

‘A will…’

Who would have thought that the will of the Duchess of Renosa would be written like this?



H.F.C Chapter 265 (Part 2):

Charlotte suddenly thought of her parents. And Michael, her angelic-faced brother who harbored a viper inside.

‘It’s been a long time since I’ve seen them.’

Charlotte had never returned to Renosa during holidays since she came back to Greta Academy four years ago on that day.

Once they confirmed their differences in intentions, there was no point in going back.

Her mother would try to change Charlotte’s mind, and facing Michael would only result in him trying to read Charlotte’s inner thoughts.

Charlotte abandoned herself as the Duchess of Renosa. Ignoring all contact from Renosa, she lived solely for one goal.

She has no regrets about not looking back at Renosa. She only feels concerned about not being able to check on her father’s health, who had recovered from a critical condition.

Ironically, although her father was the Grand Duke of Renosa, he didn’t partake in the crimes committed by Michael and her mother.

‘If His Grace the Grand Duke had been awake…’

It’s a meaningless assumption. The Grand Duke of Renosa is known for his coolheadedness.

The result wouldn’t have changed, but it’s also true that he wasn’t in a position to decide anything anyway.

Charlotte fiddled with the will and then put it down. Rather than having her resolve shaken by news delivered later, it was better to leave nothing behind.

Having firmed her resolve, Charlotte put her hand inside her cloak. She felt the solid sword handle in her cloak.

A sword preciously kept in a cloak with space expansion magic.

Charlotte’s original sword was at her waist, and the sword in her cloak wasn’t Charlotte’s. It was a sword that had lost its owner.

‘Helmut’s.’

Also, the legacy of the Sword Saint Darien.

Charlotte had smuggled that sword out of Renosa. It was to return it to its owner.

Fortunately, the sword hadn’t been disposed of yet. It would have been right to melt the sword, if only to erase the traces.

‘…To its original owner.’

She will definitely return it. Charlotte once again strengthened her resolve.

“Well now, if you’re all ready, let’s depart. The food you just ate will protect your body from demonic energy and activate your physical abilities for about ten days. It’s better to be in the Forest of Roots when the drug effects are stronger, don’t you think?”

Everyone stood up from their seats with grim faces at Antiol’s words.

A magic circle was drawn on the floor of his spacious research room.

Unfamiliar characters and shapes intricately engraved, not belonging to a mage. It was an exact copy of a sacred magic circle.

“Everyone, step up. It’s better to depart quickly, as lingering will only complicate your feelings. I’m also in the best condition right now.”

Antiol spoke calmly as if he was going for a walk. His eyes, realizing long years of research, were serious rather than excited.

Everyone stepped onto the magic circle and stood close together.

The arrival point was not random, but a certain place close to the sacred barrier. It was a precaution.

If the Forest of Roots turns out to be more dangerous than expected in the worst-case scenario, they would need to escape through the sacred barrier.

Alea warned for the last time.

“Take care of your own life. Never let your guard down.”

Soon, the magic circle was dyed in a bright white light.

*

The process of entering the sacred barrier was smoother than expected.

It felt like casting an ordinary teleportation spell.

Falling from mid-air, they quickly regained their senses and landed on the ground.

Thud, tap, thud!

“We’ve arrived properly.”

Alea was the first to speak. Unlike Antiol’s bright domain, the surroundings were noticeably gloomy.

The sky was ashen, and the sparsely scattered trees around them were all tall with lush foliage on their branches.

And not far behind them, along with the aura of holy power, was an opaque white wall. It was the sacred barrier.

“How is everyone’s condition?”

Three voices spoke in succession.

“I’m fine.”

“I’m okay too.”

“Me too.”

“Then, wait a moment.”

While Alea cast a small concealment spell around them, Asuka, who had looked around, asked excitedly,

“Hey, hey, it’s really a dense forest, isn’t it? No wonder it’s called the ‘Forest’ of Roots.”

“The air quality is really bad. It feels like we’ve come to a place from a terrifying legend.”

“Yeah, so this is the Forest of Roots where those demonic beasts are said to be swarming?”

Asuka snorted.

“Don’t wet yourself out of fear.”

“Who’s wetting themselves?”

Both of them speaking looked paler than usual. Alea, who had cast the concealment spell, opened her mouth.

“Keep your voices down. This is a dangerous place. Don’t let your tension drop. Sian, take this.”

Alea took out a large pouch from her cloak and handed it over. Sian, who opened it, muttered,

“Magic stones? Why these?”

“From now on, replenish your magic power with magic stones. We should absorb as little demonic energy as possible, even considering our exit. It will be an obstacle when passing through the barrier. Vis can’t be replenished with magic stones, so it will have to absorb demonic energy, but those two swordsmen should be able to pass through the barrier in most cases.”

“In other words, you and I have a lower chance of escaping from the Forest of Roots.”

“The longer we stay in the Forest of Roots, the lower that possibility becomes. So we should hope to meet Helmut as soon as possible.”

There’s no one here to ask for directions, or to inquire about Helmut’s whereabouts.

Finding Helmut in this vast Forest of Roots was like finding a needle in a haystack.

“The demonic energy is very dense. Everyone, let’s move.”

Alea and Charlotte took the lead side by side, and Sian followed behind, bringing out the dark spirit.

The dark spirit plays a role in enhancing the effect of the concealment spell. Asuka took the rear.

Now the adventure was beginning.

However, that adventure would soon face a very dangerous and new phase.

Due to the appearance of a certain being.



H.F.C Chapter 266 (Part 1):

They moved forward silently in a tense atmosphere. Though it seemed quiet and peaceful, this was the Forest of Roots. Anything could jump out at any moment.

They proceeded cautiously, without haste.

“Aaah! What’s this?!”

At one point, Sian yelled dramatically and kicked at the air.

A caterpillar that had been gnawing on his shoe fell off.

Where the caterpillar had been biting, a white vapor arose, and a hole formed.

Alea spoke as if it were nothing unusual.

“It’s a bug carrying acidic poison. Watch your step.”

They had managed to conceal their presence with magic, but there was nothing they could do about direct contact.

After about half a day, small creatures started to appear. It began with small and weak ones.

Sian looked around and said,

“Every tree and blade of grass is infused with demonic energy. How do they manage food supply here?”

“We brought enough food and water. Consider this just an exploration.”

There might be edible things in the Forest of Roots, but there was no need to search for them since they weren’t planning to live here.

‘The further we get from the holy barrier, the more intense the demonic energy becomes. It’s interfering with magic use.’

It felt as if the magic that usually flowed smoothly was now being filtered through a sieve.

Just as holy power conflicted with magical power, demonic energy also conflicted with magical power.

Unless one used black magic to fuse the two forces, there were some restrictions on using magic in the Forest of Roots.

This meant that Alea couldn’t exert 100% of her abilities.

‘We’ll have to manage.’

Given their thorough preparations, there shouldn’t be any major problems unless they encountered a formidable enemy.

Asuka asked Alea,

“By the way, where are we supposed to go? Shouldn’t we have at least some basic reference point?”

There was indeed a ‘minimum’ reference. Alea answered readily.

“For now, towards the center of the Forest of Roots.”

“Why there?”

“Helmut said he grew up there. I don’t know the exact location, but if he returned to the Forest of Roots, wouldn’t he have gone back to his hometown?”

Helmut had grown up in the care of Elaga, the leopard ruler of the central region.

If the meaning of ‘center’ in the Forest of Roots was no different from the outside world, it would be somewhere in the middle of the forest.

‘Elaga was said to be a huge white leopard.’

A leopard as big as a house. It could even talk.

Since the central region was the domain of Elaga, the leopard that had raised Helmut, he would probably be there.

For Helmut, who had lost his sword and fallen into the Forest of Roots, it would have been the most reliable place to go.

That is, if he was in a state to find that leopard.

‘Yes, he must be alive. He has to be.’

Alea shook off the ominous feeling that suddenly arose and organized her thoughts.

“You certainly know a lot about Helmut.”

Asuka grumbled with a somewhat dissatisfied expression. Until Alea told them, neither Asuka nor Sian knew anything about Helmut.

‘He only told everything to his girlfriend, huh.’

Despite having hidden things about himself, Asuka made an unlikely resolution to beat up Helmut.

Inside here, there were many things that interfered with magic, making it difficult to gauge direction.

The sky was always cloudy and gray, so sunlight rarely penetrated.

However, they could still sense day and night, and vaguely determine the sun’s position, which allowed them to gauge direction.

Alea focused on not losing their direction throughout the journey.

‘We should keep going this way.’

If they encountered a cliff or anything else along the way, they could just use magic to cross it. As long as they didn’t lose direction, they would reach the central region. If everything went according to plan, it should be smooth.

Since they had no other means of transportation like horses, they moved solely on foot. Naturally, their progress was not fast.

Sian glanced back and muttered,

“A bit further and we won’t be able to see the barrier anymore.”

Visibility in the Forest of Roots was poor. The holy barrier was visible from a distance because it had the property of repelling demonic energy. The fact that even that would soon be out of sight meant…

“We’re about to enter the real Forest of Roots.”

Those words sounded like an omen of something.

And just as the barrier completely disappeared from view, it appeared. What first appeared was a huge, pitch-black shadow.

In an instant, their vision darkened and wind howled from the sky. Whoosh!

“What’s that? A storm cloud?”

“In the sky… look there!”

Everyone looked up at the sky, bracing against the wind that lashed their entire bodies.

A bird with beautiful, dazzling rainbow-colored feathers was descending from the sky, flapping its wings.

It was a beautiful and overwhelmingly large bird, as if it had descended from the heavens.

But this is the Forest of Roots. That is a demonic beast. A powerful demonic beast that had no need to camouflage itself with natural colors.

Its landing motion was graceful and light. But as soon as it landed just ten paces away, a wind arose from it.

Whoosh!



H.F.C Chapter 266 (Part 2):

Alea’s concealment magic and the barrier set up by the dark spirit were instantly shattered by the gust of demonic energy.

They were exposed bare before the demonic beast’s gaze, as if it had targeted them from the start.

[Well, well, four humans? I never thought I’d see such a lucky day in my life.]

A clear voice rang out.

“Aaah! The bird is talking!”

Asuka shouted, pointing his finger. Sian poked him in the side to make him shut up.

“It’s not just a bird, it’s a demonic beast.”

‘A talking demonic beast. A demonic beast strong enough to have such intelligence, with this level of demonic energy… could it be a ruler of one of the regions?’

As if responding to Alea’s suspicion, Igrelle gracefully greeted them.

[Allow me to introduce myself, humans. My name is Igrelle. They call me Igrelle of the South.]

“The ruler of the southern region of the Forest of Roots.”

[Oh? So my name is known even in the human world?]

Igrelle laughed merrily. It was a clear, melodious birdsong that bewitched the ears.

Not only its appearance but even its voice was beautiful, seemingly out of place in the Forest of Roots.

However, separate from that, a terrifying demonic energy could be felt from it. An overwhelming, explosive demonic energy that made their skin tingle.

The eyes of the group, who had been confused by its sudden appearance, hardened. Asuka and Charlotte both tensed up and reached for their swords.

‘I didn’t expect to encounter such a powerful demonic beast so quickly.’

But crisis was opportunity. Alea stepped forward in front of the group and spoke politely.

“My name is Alea. Do you happen to know a human named Helmut?”

[Oh, human! Are you speaking to me? You’re as beautiful as my feathers. Go ahead, say my name.]

It was an irritating way of speaking. But the demonic beast before them was so strong.

Alea wasn’t foolish enough to act arrogantly in front of a powerful being. She was pragmatic and good at assessing situations.

She calmly asked a more detailed question.

“Yes, Lord Igrelle. Do you happen to know anything about a human named Helmut?”

With no one else to ask, it was fortunate that they could communicate.

[Helmut…]

Igrelle blinked. Of course, he remembered the owner of that name. There weren’t many moments as impressive as that one in Igrelle’s life.

[Well, I do know. The first human to leave the Forest of Roots! In all my life, I’ve never seen a human with such guts. Such a tiny thing, but with such lively eyes. A sense of intense desire, you could say. You could feel the ambition.]

Alea gathered from Igrelle’s words that he had encountered Helmut before.

Before Helmut left the barrier, he must have encountered this bird. And since Helmut had left the Forest of Roots, there was a high possibility that this bird wasn’t hostile towards him.

Alea casually asked a question.

“He has returned to the Forest of Roots due to an unfortunate incident. It’s been quite a while since he returned. Have you seen him?”

A moment of silence passed. Igrelle tilted his head nonchalantly.

[Returned, you say? Well, that could be. I don’t know if you’re aware, but the Forest of Roots is quite vast, so news doesn’t travel that quickly.]

Even if it weren’t vast, demonic beasts wouldn’t have proper communication among themselves.

Igrelle lowered his head slightly and asked casually.

[So, are you humans that Helmut befriended in the human world? Is that why you’ve come to find him? Into this Forest of Roots, fearless despite being human?]

“Yes.”

[How curious. Is this what humans call friendship? Affection? Something like that.]

Igrelle looked at Alea with meaningful eyes.

‘Is she Helmut’s mate?’

Alea, having removed her disguise, was a beautiful girl with silver hair and violet eyes.

The fact that she was a mage, wearing a white robe, was irrelevant to Igrelle.

What use was a mage, a weak human, in front of Igrelle, the ruler of the southern region, in this Forest of Roots, the holy land of demonic beasts?

‘Her eyes are truly like jewels. It’s rare to find a human as beautiful as my feathers.’

A glint of greed flashed in Igrelle’s eyes. Alea calmly continued her questions.

“Do you know a leopard named Elaga, by any chance?”

[That smelly, savage leopard? Of course I do. Its smell gets worse by the day. I can smell it even from afar.]

“That must be troublesome.”

[Indeed, indeed. Well, it’s not that we’re on bad terms, but…]

For some reason, Igrelle seemed to hold back at the end.

“I see. Thank you for answering my questions. If we meet Elaga, we’ll send your regards. Now, let’s go.”

Alea tried to naturally lead her group away from the spot.

However, Igrelle wasn’t so accommodating.

[When did I say I’d let you leave?]

‘As expected, if it was going to let us go easily, it wouldn’t have appeared like this.’

Alea asked with a serious look.

“What do you want from us?”

[Well, you see…]

Igrelle flapped his wings as he looked at them, drawing out the moment.

[I don’t usually eat humans. The humans in the Forest of Roots feel somewhat unclean. It’s like my noble beak would be sullied if I pecked at them.]

The expressions of everyone except Alea turned sour at once.

[So, humans were originally outside my sphere of interest, inferior beings. But after seeing that Helmut fellow, I’ve had some thoughts about humans.]

“What kind of thoughts?”

[Elaga raised that human Helmut from childhood. It was different from keeping other demonic beasts as subordinates. So…]

Igrelle, who had been tilting its head, spread its wings and declared triumphantly.

[You shall groom my feathers. If you groom them to my satisfaction, I might let you go.]



H.F.C Chapter 267 (Part 1):

The reaction to Igrelle’s demand was cold.

‘What is this crazy monster saying?’

‘This bastard!’

Especially Asuka, who wasn’t the type to tolerate such arrogance from others.

However, even the mad dog of the Swordsmanship Department had the eye to recognize an opponent stronger and more dangerous than himself.

[Don’t like it? If you don’t, why don’t you try to get past me? I believe humans call it tag? That would be fun.]

Igrelle’s eyes gleamed as it lowered its head towards them. Its beak glistened threateningly.

This was its domain. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the fate of the humans before it was in its hands.

Alea made the decision.

“Let’s do it.”

And so, just a few hours after entering the Forest of Roots, they found themselves grooming a demonic beast’s feathers.

***

[Yes, there! That feels good!]

‘Should I just stab him with my sword?’

Asuka gritted his teeth. Igrelle’s body was massive, so vast that even with all four of them working on different sections, it was still overwhelming.

The glossy, colorful feathers looked perfect for plucking and using as hat decorations.

Despite being from a demonic beast, the feathers weren’t particularly tough. On the contrary, they were soft and silky, making them pleasant to stroke.

But the demonic energy within strengthened the bones, muscles, and even the surface flesh.

An ordinary sword wouldn’t be able to penetrate it, likely slipping off the glossy surface.

Asuka combed the feathers with a brush that Alea had thrown to him from who knows where, harboring discontent.

‘I didn’t train to death at the Academy for this, did I? It’d be better to fight fiercely.’

The only reason Asuka didn’t do so was because of Alea’s message conveyed through magic.

“The probability of victory is less than 40%. Even if we succeed in escaping, significant damage on our side is expected, so let’s comply for now.”

40% was actually a generous estimate. They had never faced such a powerful demonic beast before.

Of course. In the outside world, there were no demonic beasts as powerful as Igrelle.

Igrelle, who was lying on the ground almost flat, leisurely enjoying the grooming, provoked Asuka, who seemed to have the worst temper.

[You there, clean more delicately. Blue hair, your handiwork is really rough and unskilled!]

Asuka asked gruffly.

“How long has it been since you last washed?”

Igrelle was silent for a moment. Asuka withdrew her hand and scrunched up her face.

“Ah, please wash yourself! With all this fluffy fur! How filthy.”

[Fluffy… fur? Filthy??]

Igrelle was dumbfounded by this unprecedented criticism.

This was Igrelle, who had lived proudly as the ruler of the southern region until now.

Just as he was about to get angry, another voice cut in.

“Bird feathers naturally need some oil to shine. You’ve managed them excellently. I can sense the dignity befitting the ruler of the South from these feathers.”

Asuka looked at Sian with an incredulous expression. Sian winked slightly, giving Asuka a hint.

[This one seems to know something.]

Igrelle boasted.

[I sense a strange power from you. Something like what dwells in the forest. Oh yes, that’s a spirit. You humans have diverse powers.]

They must be quite strong in the human world.

But unfortunately, as soon as they entered the Forest of Roots, they met this Igrelle. Igrelle chuckled inwardly.

At that moment, Alea stood up.

“I’m finished.”

[Oh, you, your skill is remarkable. As expected, the beautiful ones are also talented. Very good.]

The feathers that Alea had groomed were perfectly aligned, shining brightly.

As expected of a model student, Alea had focused and finished the job.

“I’m glad you’re satisfied.”

Alea replied indifferently and looked at the others. It was a urge to finish quickly without further ado. She had no intention of helping.

Igrelle’s focus shifted to Charlotte, who was quietly grooming his feathers.

[You, the quiet black-haired human woman. What’s your relationship with Helmut? Are you his kin?]

“That’s correct.”

[I thought so? You smell similar to that guy. Blood ties can’t be hidden.]

“I see.”

A bitter smile flashed across Charlotte’s face.

Although blood ties couldn’t be hidden, it was none other than that blood that had betrayed Helmut.

Charlotte herself couldn’t be free from that sin either.

In the silence, Igrelle leisurely enjoyed the humans’ touch.



H.F.C Chapter 267 (Part 2):

‘So this is how it feels to have humans groom your feathers? Elaga has been enjoying such a good thing all by itself!’

It felt like experiencing a new world. Actually, Igrelle had known for a while that Helmut had returned to the Forest of Roots.

He couldn’t have missed it, with all the noise Helmut made smashing up the Forest of Roots right after his return.

Fortunately for Helmut, he quickly approached the central region and caught Elaga’s attention not long after going berserk.

If the ruler of another region had stepped in, they wouldn’t have spared Helmut, who was rampaging under the influence of the Seed of Darkness. Igrelle could also guess why Helmut had returned.

‘For a guy who left with such desperate eyes to come back, well, he must have been backstabbed by humans.’

Even the demonic beasts of the Forest of Roots, who rarely interacted with humans, knew enough about human nature to predict this.

It wasn’t particularly a lowly view of humans. Relationships among demonic beasts were just more primitive. Eating each other, using each other, that kind of bond-less relationship.

Of course, Igrelle didn’t feel any sympathy for Elaga that Elaga didn’t have.

‘Tsk, so weak. He should have been more cautious out there.’

Regardless of what happened to Helmut, Igrelle was slightly envious of Elaga in a corner of its heart.

He had heard that Elaga, as if it’d hit some kind of jackpot, had not only grown stronger by eating the core of Naho, but had also rescued human women to use as masseuses.

Because of that, its white fur had become as white as snow and gained a sheen.

So Igrelle tried to imitate Elaga a bit, and it turned out to be really good.

Its initial hesitation about whether to let these humans go or not tilted towards one side. Towards not wanting to let them go.

‘If they entered my domain, aren’t they mine? If you don’t like it, be stronger than me.’

In the southern region of the Forest of Roots, Igrelle itself was the law. It thought like an outlaw.

And as time passed, everyone’s feather grooming came to an end.

Even Asuka, who wore a bitter expression, had somewhat diligently completed the task assigned to him.

The colorful feathers sprouting from Igrelle’s vast body now held a more brilliant light than before.

Igrelle, lost in self-admiration, looked down at its own feathers. They looked much better than when it groomed them itself.

[Excellent! Indeed, humans are useful. This is something demonic beasts can’t do!]

“Are you satisfied now?”

At Alea’s question, Igrelle immediately shook his head.

[It’s still not enough. If you’ve trespassed into my domain, you should pay a proper price.]

Igrelle, who had suddenly reverted to an arrogant attitude, scrutinized the four of them. And he declared.

[Hmm, isn’t there anything interesting? Show me something, all of you.]

***

When Sian brought out all the spirits he had and showed a performance of tricks, Igrelle watched with satisfaction.

But his demands continued. Something was lacking. Show me more.

Alea used illusion magic to paint scenes in the air that were hard to see in the Forest of Roots, and Asuka and Charlotte performed a sword dance at Igrelle’s request.

But Igrelle’s demands knew no end.

[Is there nothing else to show? Something grand, something eye-opening!]

Finally, Sian secretly sent a message to Alea using magic.

“How long do we have to keep doing this? It seems like there’s no end to this.”

“I thought it might let us go if we indulged it, but it doesn’t seem to be working.”

Igrelle wasn’t as ferocious as Alea had assessed. Didn’t say it doesn’t even eat humans?

But Igrelle was persistent and, above all, had too much free time. Enough to hold them and try to extract fun or whatever until they died.

Alea spoke to Igrelle.

“Now, as promised, please let us go.”

[Huh? Did I make such a promise?]

Igrelle asked innocently.

[I clearly said I might let you go, not that I would let you go.]

“We are humans, and the Forest of Roots is not a place for us to stay.”

[I can protect you. Now that it’s come to this, how about staying here with me? I can guarantee your safety. If you want to build a village, you can do that too.]

Igrelle’s attitude was leisurely, but somehow ironclad.

“We’re going to leave the Forest of Roots after we find Helmut.”

[Leave after you find him? Well, you might be able to leave again, but isn’t it impossible for dear Helmut? And he might not want that? Helmut might want to live in the Forest of Roots.]

As Igrelle rebutted, Alea’s eyes narrowed. She realized one fact from Igrelle’s words.

“Helmut is in the Forest of Roots. And you, Igrelle, have heard news about him.”

[Uh, um?]

At this direct point, Igrelle flinched and rolled its eyes. Alea pressed further.

“Helmut is in Elaga’s domain, isn’t he?”

Finally, Igrelle sighed.

[As beautiful as you are smart, human kid. Alea, was it? I like you more and more.]

Greed appeared in Igrelle’s eyes. It was an emotion more intense than before.

It envied Elaga for having Helmut.

But if it could have this beautiful, talented, and smart human before Elaga, it wouldn’t have to envy Elaga.

Alea realized that she couldn’t persuade this giant with kind words. She immediately spoke in a cold and clear tone.

“Igrelle, of course we can’t defeat you. But Elaga is different, isn’t it?”

Igrelle, who had seemed to shrink earlier when Elaga’s name was mentioned, showed a similar reaction this time as well.

[…Do you think Elaga would fight me for your sake?]

Alea quickly noticed their hierarchical relationship. Although they were both rulers of regions, Elaga was above Igrelle.

“Charlotte over there is Helmut’s younger sister, and the rest are Helmut’s friends. If anything happens to us, Helmut won’t stand idle. And if Helmut steps in, Elaga will too.”

Igrelle whined.

[But I don’t want to let you go? It’s over if it doesn’t reach Elaga’s ears. Do you know how far it is from here to the central region!]

“If the four of us split up and run, even you, Igrelle, won’t be able to stop us.”

Igrelle flinched at Alea’s declaration. But the stubbornness of one who had lived as a ruler of a region rose up.

‘How dare you threaten me? No matter how much I like this human, I can’t yield to threats from mere humans!’

Demonic beasts are sometimes like children. If they don’t like something, they don’t like it regardless of any rational reasons.

Sensing Igrelle’s reaction, Alea threw out a compromise in a softer tone.

“Then, how about this?”



H.F.C Chapter 268 (Part 1):

“Igrelle, please come with us. Even if you go to the Central Region with us, you won’t have to fight with Elaga. We’ll groom your feathers as much as you want throughout the journey.”

This was Alea’s clever plan. First, traveling with Igrelle ensures their safety.

In the world of demonic beasts, it’s survival of the fittest. No beast would dare target humans in the presence of Igrelle, the ruler of the South, which would lighten their burden considerably.

It was a method of avoiding danger with danger.

Moreover, being with Igrelle would make it easier to meet Elaga.

If Igrelle appears in his territory, Elaga would have no choice but to show up as well.

‘Helmut spoke as if he trusted that leopard called Elaga.’

Almost like family. Demonic beasts are different from humans. If they mention Helmut’s name, that beast called Elaga won’t attack them.

Elaga should know where Helmut is. They might even be together.

‘It’s not that there’s no way to find Helmut.’

However, it was uncertain whether that method would work in this Forest of Roots, which interferes with magic. Even if it did work, it would only be effective at close range.

It was a method that couldn’t be used before reaching the Central Region.

Igrelle immediately understood Alea’s meaning.

[So you’re asking me to protect you all the way to the Central Region? You’re a cunning human.]

“It’s a mutually beneficial method that will satisfy both Igrelle and us.”

[What makes you think I’d trust you and go to Elaga’s territory? Are you trying to get Elaga to harm me?]

Alea replied with irritating calmness.

“Are you afraid?”

Igrelle’s wings fluttered. He threateningly brought his beak close to Alea.

As Asuka and Charlotte tensely reached for their swords, Alea calmly met Igrelle’s gaze. As if asking what the problem was.

[Listen, that Helmut guy isn’t normal. Right after returning to the Forest of Roots, his core went berserk, oh right, you humans call it the ‘Seed of darkness’? He was rampaging all over the place because of that.]

For a moment, Alea’s expressionless face changed.

“Is… that so, is he alright?”

The emotion that briefly flashed in her trembling voice was intensely earnest.

‘Well, well, she really seems to be that Helmut guy’s mate, doesn’t she?’

[I don’t know. He’s probably alive since he didn’t die. Well, Elaga raised him like its own cub, so I’m sure it took care of it somehow?]

Igrelle continued speaking indifferently.

[Even if he’s alive, humans change easily. Are you still friends to that Helmut? He might try to tear you apart the moment he sees you. Unless it’s a demonic beast of my level, they become ferocious when influenced by demonic energy.]

‘Oh, that’s a bit…’

Asuka and Sian looked at each other as they imagined a ferocious Helmut. It was a situation they’d rather avoid. But Alea answered cleanly.

“It doesn’t matter.”

[It doesn’t matter? Even if you die?]

Looks that said “we do care” were directed at Alea, but she didn’t waver.

“I won’t die, and if I was afraid of death, I wouldn’t have entered the Forest of Roots in the first place. Igrelle.”

Alea bowed her head to the giant bird before her.

“Please.”

She started off strong and then softened her attitude. It’s a method that works quite well in the human world. Igrelle couldn’t refuse when a human of its liking approached it like this. It reluctantly agreed.

[…Well, alright. A journey with humans, huh. That’s unique in its own way. But in return, you must diligently groom my feathers every single day!]

The adventure in the dangerous Forest of Roots suddenly turned into serving a giant bird.

It became more troublesome, but the danger certainly decreased.

Asuka brightened up as she remembered something.

“Then, will you carry us on your back and fly?”

Riding such a large bird, looking down at the Forest of Roots while flying, would be a rare experience. A sense of excitement washed over her.

However, Igrelle immediately flapped his wings angrily.

[Insolent fool! How dare a weak human try to climb on this beautiful and noble body!]

Charlotte asked, as if genuinely curious.

“Then, will you walk with us?”

Igrelle realized its mistake. That was the problem with going together.

Humans are land animals, and Igrelle is a sky animal. Igrelle’s flying speed is incredibly fast.

It often thoughtlessly flew through the sky and entered other regions of the Forest of Roots.

But since the concept of regions is closer to the ground, the rulers of other regions didn’t pay much attention to the rainbow-colored bird floating in the air.

That’s how Igrelle learned about Helmut’s news too.

After a brief moment of contemplation, Igrelle blurted out.

[Y-Yes! I will walk! Follow me!]
