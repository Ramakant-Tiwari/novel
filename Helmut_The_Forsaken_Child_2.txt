Igrelle started walking ahead as if to show off. Somehow, walking through the forest felt awkward.

Anyway, the problem was solved, and after glancing at each other, the group followed behind Igrelle.

Asuka grumbled inwardly.

‘This isn’t even a pigeon. Why is a bird walking on the ground?’

Fortunately, this time Asuka didn’t say it out loud. It was because Alea gave him a cold look to watch his manners.

‘If only that guy had kept his mouth shut, we might have been able to persuade it to let us ride.’

Asuka was being a nuisance every time he opened his mouth.

And so, their adventure resumed smoothly.



H.F.C Chapter 268 (Part 2):

The moment the four companions passed through the sacred barrier, a faint ripple shook the Forest of Roots.

Zing! And that ripple soon became wind. Rustle.

It made a sound as it brushed past the trees and fell between the leaves.

“Hmm.”

He suddenly looked up at the sky. The gray sky was the same as yesterday. But he felt strange. A sensation he had never felt in the past four years. Like a sign of something.

‘Is it my imagination?’

He lowered his head. This is the Forest of Roots.

To outsiders, it’s a terrifying place where unknown dangers may strike, but to some, it’s as peaceful as a lake scenery.

A place that passes time without any drastic changes.

It was quite familiar to him, who had lived most of his life here.

‘…It’s been 4 years already.’

He, Helmut, suddenly counted the years that had passed. 4 years since he returned.

Living without being aware of the passage of time, he had already grown into a tall young man.

Black hair darker than the night of the Forest of Roots where even starlight barely penetrates, and eyes that held an abyss.

His skin, once briefly tanned, had turned pale white again.

His face, calm but holding sharpness, was now that of a young man with no trace of youthfulness left.

The calm yet imposing aura emanating from his eyes and entire body was also that of a swordsman who had reached a high level.

‘I guess that’s enough for today.’

Feeling odd, Helmut put down his sword. The Helmut who once feared even the smallest beast in the Forest of Roots had become so strong that he could now dominate as a predator with his bare hands.

Just as he was about to sink into contemplation, there was a voice calling him.

“Helmut, it’s time to eat!”

A woman appeared from the other side. She was a kind-looking woman wearing shabby cloth with leather patches.

“Helmut?”

“Yes, Susan.”

As he turned around from where he was standing in the shade, Susan flinched. Even though she knew he wasn’t dangerous, perhaps due to his appearance, she felt involuntarily intimidated whenever she saw Helmut in dark places.

His eerie and imposing aura, along with his expressionless face, gave an inhuman impression.

Even though she had seen with her own eyes that he was a human capable of feeling despair.

She remembered the boy who had collapsed like a corpse with empty eyes four years ago.

She had watched that boy get up again, grasp a sword, and grow up. For four years.

‘Yet he still feels unfamiliar at times.’

Is it because of the wounds he suffered from the human world? Or is it just his original personality?

Helmut was a man of few words, and he rarely revealed what was in his heart.

And while he thanked Susan for bringing food, he never asked anything more from her.

Their interaction was truly minimal, and the distance between Susan and Helmut was always maintained far apart. Neither getting closer nor farther.

A sense of distance as if a wall had been built.

Despite spending quite a long time together, it felt more like distant neighbors rather than family. Together, but not accepted.

However, her daughter didn’t seem to feel that way at all.

“Helmut! What are you dawdling for, I’m hungry!”

Sarah, who had run up behind Susan, waved her hands dramatically. Having grown considerably, she now had the appearance of a proper young lady rather than a child.

Originally, she should have grown up comfortably as a daughter of a noble family, but Sarah’s hands holding the sword were full of calluses.

While feeling sorry about this, Susan spoke sternly.

“Sarah, how dare you say ‘dawdling’ to your master. What kind of language is that!”

“What’s the big deal? Helmut won’t mind, right?”

As she said, Helmut didn’t seem to care. He looked at the mother and daughter with indifferent eyes and replied, “I’ll come.”

They soon sat down at a wooden table with food in front of them. Due to the once-existing human village, they had decent household items, so there wasn’t much inconvenience in living. Above all, there was always someone who supplied them with food.

Helmut suddenly asked.

“Where’s Elaga?”

Elaga, who always joined them at mealtimes like the head of the family, watching them even though it didn’t eat human food.

But today, Elaga was nowhere to be seen. Could it be related to the strange feeling from earlier?

“Elaga said it was going to check the territory for a bit. But is something on your mind, Helmut? You seem to be thinking.”

When Sarah asked what Susan couldn’t, Helmut responded indifferently.

“I don’t know.”

“You always answer like everything’s a bother! Why are you always like that, Helmut? So listless.”

‘How noisy.’

Helmut looked at Sarah, who was chattering beside him, with fresh eyes.

It was strange that her presence only now caught his attention, as Sarah had always been a noisy and bothersome disciple to Helmut.

His disciple. After all, Helmut is Sarah’s swordsmanship master.

‘A master, huh…’

In fact, although he was called a master, Helmut hadn’t really put much effort into teaching Sarah all this time.

His attitude was that she could learn if she wanted to, and quit if it was too hard.

But Sarah persevered and asked for more teachings. Unlike Susan, Sarah, being a child, easily approached Helmut and spoke to him.

In other words, she was constantly annoying him.



H.F.C Chapter 269 (Part 1):

‘She was annoying, but because of that…’

His mind was fixated on her, preventing him from recalling unnecessary memories. That’s what Sarah meant to Helmut.

Time flowed like water currents, buried beneath the surface.

‘This child has improved a lot during this time.’

Though not at Helmut’s level, who possessed the Seed of Darkness and received Darien’s harsh training, Sarah’s skills had grown quite rapidly.

Enough to take down most low-level demonic beasts.

‘In the outside world, she could be treated as a third-rank mercenary.’

That means she can protect herself to some extent. Although Darien’s swordsmanship wasn’t fully passed on, learning common swordsmanship properly is sufficient to build skills.

Sarah was a girl who possessed both talent and diligence.

A vibrant 12-year-old. Today too, Sarah had come running here after touring Elaga’s domain for physical training.

“Helmut, why aren’t you eating? You’re staring at me weirdly. Are you going to hit me again!”

“I’ve never hit you.”

Sarah had an exceptional talent for making Helmut speak. It irritated him when she spoke of things that never happened as if they had.

Having received education at the academy, Helmut couldn’t tolerate being treated as someone who frequently hit a young girl.

Sarah grinned brightly, holding a piece of meat she had been nibbling on.

“Wow, you finally spoke.”

Susan smiled softly as she watched them.

“Sarah, stop chattering and eat your meal.”

Somehow, he felt like sighing. Are children always like this?

‘I don’t think I was like this.’

Perhaps that’s why Elaga often compared Helmut to Sarah, demanding from him the cuteness and charm he lacked.

‘Why is your expression so stiff! Look at how that child smiles! Doesn’t it make the world seem brighter?’

This continued even now, when Helmut was 19 years old.

How could one demand the charmingness of a 12-year-old from a 19-year-old young man?

Whenever Elaga demanded such playfulness from Helmut, even Susan would make an awkward expression.

‘Right, it lacks common sense.’

Helmut himself wasn’t particularly common either, so expecting it from Elaga, a demonic beast, would be foolish.

‘Sending them outside quickly would be less troublesome.’

At least to Elaga, Sarah was just young.

Only 12 years old. Even if all sins are forgiven upon leaving the Forest of Roots, her family has been exterminated.

Being traitors, everyone would avoid them, so she can’t live using her original family name.

The outside world isn’t easy for a girl with no connections to survive with just the swordsmanship skills of a third-rank mercenary.

Even more so if she’s with Susan, who has no power.

But Sarah wouldn’t want to part with Susan either.

She wants to go to the outside world, but above all, what she desires is to be with her mother.

After all, she wanted to learn swordsmanship to protect Susan.

Perhaps the fearful and suffocating memories of being thrown into the Forest of Roots and being oppressed by Erugo and magical beasts at first served as a strong motivation for Sarah to learn swordsmanship.

Fortunately, not long after they entered the Forest of Roots, both Naho and Erugo died, and they came under Elaga’s shadow, so they didn’t suffer greatly.

‘If Susan is the issue, she can go with her too.’

Helmut realized one thing he had been missing through Sarah.

A new method that didn’t exist before he left the Forest of Roots.

Elaga had extracted the demonic energy from the rampaging Helmut.

And just as Elaga did with Helmut, it could extract demonic energy from others. From Susan and Sarah too.

When asked how this was possible, Elaga tilted its head and said it seemed to have become possible after absorbing Naho’s core.

It was in the realm of instinct, where even it didn’t know the principle of how it was possible.

‘Has Elaga awakened another demonic nature as it grew as a demonic beast?’

Anyway, if all the demonic energy is extracted from Susan’s body using this principle, she too could pass through the sacred barrier.

Of course, she would suffer a shock due to the remaining traces of demonic energy, but it wouldn’t be as painful as childbirth, so Susan, being a mother, should be able to endure it well.

‘It wouldn’t be bad to leave now.’

Elaga was already periodically extracting demonic energy from Susan and Sarah.

While demonic energy helps to some extent in achievements as a swordsman or magician, it also eats away at the body just as much.

It’s a power that harms if not fully embraced and utilized like a demonic beast.

The demonic energy accumulating in the body of a powerless human woman like Susan was shortening her lifespan.

Thanks to Elaga, Susan and Sarah were living healthily in the Forest of Roots, experiencing only the inconveniences of living in a remote area, without any other problems.

They couldn’t leave simply because their life outside wasn’t guaranteed.

Then suddenly, a thought occurred to him.



H.F.C Chapter 269 (Part 2):

‘Would it be worth gathering the treasures in the Forest of Roots?’

While Helmut couldn’t think of looting the human farm’s treasures back then as he had to be careful of Naho’s attention, now those things are ownerless.

There seemed to be quite a few gold items and swords. Money makes many things easier.

She might not be able to learn more swordsmanship from Helmut, but now that she has a decent foundation, she can train on her own from now on.

After all, Sarah doesn’t aim to become an extraordinary swordsman.

There’s no need for Sarah to earn money by doing dangerous mercenary work like Helmut.

If she hides her identity and settles in a suitable village with Susan, her current skills might be sufficient.

The judgment that she would struggle to live with her current skills was based on the premise of earning money through mercenary work.

Perhaps knowing that they would eventually part ways prevented him from becoming more familiar with this mother and daughter.

‘I was a transfer student, but it would be fine for Sarah to enter the academy at 14.’

With Sarah’s growth rate, by the time she’s 14, she could easily compete for the top spot even at Greta Academy. Helmut could write her a letter of recommendation. It seemed that Ethan Kudrow would continue to be an instructor at Greta Academy. He might even be able to entrust this mother and daughter to him.

What face would Ethan make if Sarah came to him with Helmut’s letter of recommendation?

Would he be happy to confirm that Helmut wasn’t dead?

Or. Helmut couldn’t imagine what face the people of the human world would make when they confirmed his survival.

There were both good and bad relationships, but now he doesn’t know which were which.

What he thought were good relationships might have been illusions.

Helmut was strong and an excellent swordsman. Humans naturally kneel before the strong.

‘They might be rejoicing that I’ve disappeared.’

He had heard that humans sometimes rejoice in the misfortunes of others.

None of the negative stories about humans that Darien had told him had been proven wrong so far. His advice was correct, and Helmut had learned it painfully.

There was only one certainty, but that truth had faded over the four years that had passed.

Helmut probably would never be able to confirm what he had left behind in the human world.

‘I’m the only one who can’t leave.’

A heavy truth settled. That’s probably why the high priests of Lumen didn’t eliminate him on the spot but concluded by sending him to the Forest of Roots again.

Elaga, who had no intention of leaving in the first place, was originally a demonic beast, so she might not care, but for Helmut, who couldn’t find a reason to leave, that fact was still heavy.

‘It’s not like I know how to leave anyway.’

The success in leaving last time was really due to luck. Even with such good luck, Helmut almost died.

‘There’s nothing stopping me from trying a second time when all I have to lose is my life.’

Even if the amount of Vis has increased, it’s useless now that the Seed of Darkness has grown and taken deeper root in Helmut.

Helmut instinctively felt this. It was no longer just a matter of demonic energy retention. Because the Seed of Darkness had become closer to a ‘core’ that Helmut couldn’t afford to lose anymore.

Because humans can die even from a small wound to the heart.

That Seed of Darkness kept Helmut alive and made him stronger, but now it became a restriction again.

He had overcome many trials, but was back to square one.

However, even by his own reckoning, he was a special case.

He didn’t die even after falling into the Forest of Roots as a newborn, met Darien as a master, became strong, and left the Forest of Roots.

‘I survived even when the Seed of Darkness went berserk.’

Although he had Elaga’s help, Helmut overcame one wall because of it.

A wall that would have taken a really long time to overcome if he were in the human world.

All that process at least made him stronger.

‘I wonder how close I’ve gotten to Darien now.’

Darien, whom even a domain ruler couldn’t handle.

It was a fact that remained unknown even when tracing back his memories.

Although he had become stronger than before, being with Elaga, a demonic beast who could handle the strengthened Helmut like a toy, made it even more unclear.

‘What’s important now is them.’

“I should talk to Elaga.”

Sarah looked at him curiously at his sudden words.

“About what?”

“Leaving the Forest of Roots.”

“What? So suddenly.”

Susan’s eyes widened.

“Have you found a way out?”

“There’s no way for me to leave, but there is a way for you to leave.”

Helmut didn’t explain at length. Elaga’s cooperation was needed anyway.

Both for extracting demonic energy and passing through the sacred barrier, they need to go that far, which inevitably means encountering Igrelle, the ruler of the southern domain.

It was unclear whether Igrelle would be so compliant this time.

“Your fate depends on Elaga’s decision, so it must agree.”

Even if it’s not a human farm, Elaga seems to treat them as its pet humans.

Susan and Sarah were accepting this fact willingly. After all, isn’t being a pet human better than being livestock to be eaten?

Helmut had no doubt that Elaga would cooperate in letting them out even if it was reluctant. It had done so when Helmut left the Forest of Roots.

If Susan and Sarah ask, Elaga, being a timid yet generous leopard, will grumble but take them to the Igrelle barrier.

And as the meal was coming to an end, Elaga returned.



H.F.C Chapter 270 (Part 1):

“What happened, Elaga?”

Sarah immediately asked Elaga, who appeared ambling around the territory.

Elaga sat down on the ground and glanced at her.

[What do you mean, what happened? Nothing much.]

“Is there some kind of disturbance in the Forest of Roots?” Helmut asked pointedly.

Elaga shook its head.

[I thought so, but it’s nothing to do with my territory.]

Despite saying this, it seemed like something had happened. Helmut pressed further.

“So something happened outside the central region.”

Elaga responded, seemingly annoyed.

[Someone broke through the sacred barrier from outside and entered. Of course, it must be humans.]

All three of them flinched. It had been a while since there were exiles. This hadn’t happened for several years.

The Forest of Roots was like an ecosystem. Therefore, someone entering from the outside was like a meteor falling – a significant change.

Those with particularly sensitive senses, especially the rulers of the regions, keenly sense when someone enters from the outside.

In Naho’s case, he secretly sent his subordinates to collect humans even if they fell into other territories, but other regional rulers generally didn’t pay that much attention to inspect their territories.

Elaga tilted its head.

[This wave was a bit strange, but… anyway, it’s not really important.]

Susan asked with an urgent expression.

“Elaga, then what about those humans…?”

[They’re either already dead, or about to die, one of the two. Let me tell you, I can’t do anything about what happens outside my territory.]

Elaga spoke as if it wasn’t a big deal.

A beast cannot be an altruist. It’s not in their nature from the start.

Unlike what Helmut might have thought, Elaga wasn’t particularly interested in farm-like activities where humans under his control would multiply and form villages.

Taking care of three humans was enough. Why should it care about humans dying somewhere far away, not even in its territory?

Elaga rules the central region of the Forest of Roots.

Its territory was already large enough, so it didn’t extend to include Naho’s territory.

As a result, Naho’s territory, except for the human farm, remained ownerless land.

Those who enter from the outside fall somewhere in the Forest of Roots, but it’s rare for them to fall in the central region, which is farthest from the barrier.

Finding Helmut had been a pure stroke of luck for Elaga.

Susan said with a sad face.

“How pitiful. I hope at least their passing is painless.”

Her face showed resignation, even though her words were kind. After a moment of thought, she calmed herself, not insisting on going to rescue them.

After all, those who fall into the Forest of Roots aren’t necessarily good people.

While some, like Susan, were unfortunate victims caught in the winds of rebellion, criminals like Erugo who deserved execution were also exiled to the Forest of Roots.

More than half of those exiled had committed such wicked deeds.

There was no need to risk their current peaceful life by trying to save them out of misplaced sympathy. She had a young daughter too.

But that young daughter had a different opinion. Sarah shouted with an angry expression.

“How can you talk so casually about people dying! I’m disappointed in both Elaga and Mom!”

Elaga snorted.

[What disappointment? I’m a beast, you know? Have you ever seen a beast saving humans?]

“Sarah… There’s nothing we can do. Elaga can’t bring and protect all the humans who fall into the Forest of Roots.”

“But we won’t know if we can save them unless we try!”

“They might not be people we should save.”

“There might be a child like me among them! What sin could a child have committed!”

[Oh, so you want to make friends? One noisy child like you is enough for me.]

Sarah was affectionate, but sometimes annoyingly noisy.

It was exactly like Helmut when he was young. Helmut too used to annoy Elaga with constant questions.

Still, it was fortunate that her mother Susan was there to indulge her.

Sarah shouted loudly.

“Stupid leopard! You’re mean!”

[Hey, I told you it didn’t happen in my territory, didn’t I? By human standards… would you go save people dying in a distant neighboring country?]

“Well, that’s not…”

[Of course, I could save humans who fell into another beast’s territory. But then I’d have more mouths to feed. Three is enough for me! I don’t want my territory to be covered in human smell.]

Helmut then calmly stepped in.

“There is a way to reduce that burden.”

Everyone’s attention focused on Helmut. Sarah’s eyes hoped that Helmut would take her side.



H.F.C Chapter 270 (Part 2):

As if he had something to say anyway, Helmut naturally suggested without waiting for an opportunity.

“You could send out Sarah and Susan.”

As if stating a very simple fact.

Soon, Sarah had a puzzled expression.

“You mean you’ll drive us out of the territory?”

“You’ll send us out? Do you mean out of the Forest of Roots?”

When Susan asked again, Helmut nodded. He immediately talked about what he had thought.

When his story ended, everyone’s expression became serious. Sarah clapped her hands together.

“Wow, I’ve never seen Helmut talk this much before!”

She looked genuinely amazed. Susan asked with a serious face.

“So, you’re saying that if Elaga removes the demonic energy from our bodies, we could pass through the sacred barrier? Sarah and I could do it, even though it might be difficult.”

“Yes.”

“What about Helmut? Won’t Helmut leave?”

“I can’t leave that way.”

“Why not?”

Instead of explaining in detail, Helmut answered simply.

“Because I have the Seed of Darkness. You don’t.”

At his resolute answer, Susan’s face showed regret.

Helmut couldn’t tell if it was because she couldn’t leave with him, who seemed reliable, or if she felt sorry for his reality of not being able to leave the forest.

“Could we… really leave? To the human world?”

Sarah, who was earlier making a fuss about going to save people, was now focused on Helmut’s words. Her face lit up.

“There’s no need to rush. Sarah can leave after she gains more skills and grows stronger. If we search the village, we might find things that could be valuable outside. If you take those with you…”

Susan shook her head. She looked even brighter.

“Noble families keep secret accounts in banks. There should be enough there for the two of us to live comfortably.”

“Then there’s no problem.”

Helmut thought of his own wealth, now useless.

‘If I had known it would come to this, I should have given all of Darien’s wealth to Luke Yeager.’

Unlike his past self who was interested in accumulating wealth, Helmut’s heart had become generous. But anyway, Luke Yeager would have become the commander of the Palma Knights. He would have risen to a position of wealth and honor, so he wouldn’t feel the lack of it.

Now Helmut’s wealth was in an untouchable realm.

He didn’t know how to transfer it, and it was better not to get involved by trying to transfer it to Sarah or Susan.

If by any chance they were caught, it might turn Renosa against them.

“We’ve lived here with so little that even if we want to leave, there’s not much to prepare.”

Susan spoke as if she would leave right away if she could.

Thanks to being under Elaga’s protection, they didn’t live particularly hard lives, but the environment of the Forest of Roots itself was hostile to humans.

Especially for her, who had no power, it was an even harsher environment.

The air full of demonic energy was suffocating, and the sky was always gloomy. Apart from eating, making clothes, and simple labor, there was nothing else they could do.

The only person she could talk to was her young daughter Sarah.

“It’ll be enough if Elaga removes the demonic energy and takes us near the sacred barrier.”

Then Elaga’s disgruntled voice echoed.

[Why should I do that? You’re talking as if I’ll naturally agree?]

Even though Elaga must have known they might leave the Forest of Roots someday while watching Sarah learn swordsmanship, it was unexpectedly opposing.

Had it grown attached to them over time? Or was it a beast’s possessiveness? Either way, it wouldn’t be such a strong opposition.

“You said we were a burden. You always said it was annoying to take care of us.”

Helmut calmly pointed out. Elaga, looking a bit stung, grumbled.

[So, you want to leave me here with only you, all grown up and not cute anymore but disgusting? I don’t like that.]

“If you want, I can leave for somewhere else as well.”

[Who said to do that?]

Susan spoke as if she had made up her mind.

“Um, lord Elaga. I’m fine, so please let Sarah go. That child barely lived in the human world. If I leave, I’ll just be a burden to Sarah.”

Sarah shouted loudly.

“I won’t leave without Mom!”

Somehow, the atmosphere became chaotic. It was also becoming an atmosphere where Elaga was turning into the bad guy, but Elaga, being a beast, didn’t care at all.

Facing it, who looked nonchalant, Helmut raised his eyebrows and said.

“Elaga, stop being stubborn unnecessarily-”

[It’s not stubbornness, you know? Think about it. When you left the Forest of Roots, were you stronger than Sarah?]

Elaga spoke as if that would probably be the case.

From Elaga’s perspective, Sarah and Helmut were both so weak that it couldn’t tell the difference.

Feeling somehow irritated, Helmut answered emphatically.

“By an incomparable margin.”

[Right, and you became even stronger in the human world. Isn’t that so? What was your position among humans?]

“In a simple one-on-one fight, I was at a level where I wouldn’t lose to anyone.”

Strong individuals like Darien were extremely rare, and it was questionable if there were any. Anyway, Helmut had never met such a person, so that was true.

Elaga made a doubtful expression. From its perspective, Helmut was still just a weak and young human.

In fact, Elaga had subdued Helmut without much difficulty even when he had gone berserk.

Even though humans were weak, was Helmut really that strong?

Elaga put aside its minor doubts and agreed.

[Fine, let’s say you were that strong. But even you, who were that strong, were defeated and chased back to this Forest of Roots, right?]

“That’s because I… was betrayed.”

[Right, whether you were betrayed or whatever. I sent you out hoping things would go well, but you came back in such a state. After seeing that, do you think I want to send someone else out again? Don’t you agree?]

For a moment, it was a compelling argument that left them speechless.



H.F.C Chapter 271 (Part 1):

Helmut calmly refuted.

“That’s wrong. I had the Seed of Darkness, and those with the Seed of Darkness are threatening. They are not.”

Even as he said it out loud, his heart ached, and Helmut frowned. Yes. There must have been unavoidable circumstances.

However, the ruthless decision made under those unavoidable circumstances was deeply bitter.

Helmut was ruthless, but only towards his enemies. Being abandoned by those he couldn’t bear to be ruthless toward was unspeakably cruel.

If forgiveness means forgetting what happened to you, Helmut would probably never know forgiveness for the rest of his life.

[But they are weaker than you. And you were lucky enough to be able to return to the Forest of Roots, but they might be killed without even getting such a chance? Is there any guarantee that coming out alive from the Forest of Roots will absolve your sins or whatever? Humans tend to kill first if someone bothers them. It’s safer here because I can protect you inside the Forest of Roots.]

It was an uncharacteristically reasonable argument from Elaga.

[Do you think I saved you all just to have you die in vain? Don’t be ridiculous. I’ve had enough with sending that Helmut guy out.]

‘You saved us as a hobby.’

Everyone thought, but for Elaga, raising humans was quite an endearing hobby. Naturally, it became attached to the subjects of its hobby.

“Then I just need to become stronger,” Sarah said firmly.

“Elaga is right. I’m weak and my mother is even weaker. But if I become stronger…!”

[Even if you get stronger, you won’t be able to catch up to Helmut. He has the Seed of Darkness and you don’t.]

“S-still. We can hide our identities and live, right?”

[Helmut must have hidden his thoroughly too. Wouldn’t he have? But once it was revealed, look what happened. It’s not something you can control.]

It was an unexpected insight. Helmut had never spoken about what he had gone through.

As Elaga said, there are risks. If Sarah stands out in the human world, news might reach those who branded her family as traitors in some way.

Even if they live quietly, someone might recognize Susan if she’s with her.

One way or another, the risk can’t be zero. It’s clear that the human world is more dangerous than the Forest of Roots, where Elaga has overwhelming control and can regulate almost all variables.

But still.

Just as Susan was about to open her mouth to persuade it, Elaga turned away, unnecessarily losing its temper.

[If you really want to leave or whatever, then do it! But don’t ask me for help!]

An uncharacteristic harshness. The remaining three could only watch Elaga’s retreating back. After a moment, Helmut spoke.

“It will be difficult without Elaga’s help.”

“Even if it’s hard for me, couldn’t Sarah still leave?”

“She could. But Sarah is too young to go out alone.”

Twelve years old. Even in a country where early marriage was common, one couldn’t deny it was a young age. Too early to leave her mother’s embrace.

Helmut left the Forest of Roots at fourteen. And the Helmut of that time was incomparably stronger than Sarah.

“There’s no need to rush. Let’s wait a few more years.”

“Yes, I guess I was too hasty. Elaga has taken care of us, and we’re being ungrateful… It’s just that this place is so bleak.”

Susan’s face visibly fell. Helmut looked at her face somewhat questioningly.

He couldn’t quite understand why she, who had lost everything, would want to go outside and take risks.

Helmut asked.

“Is it because life here is uncomfortable?”

Elaga’s domain is safe, and Susan knows that. So it can’t be because of threats to her life.

As the daughter of a noble family who grew up comfortably, she must find it particularly difficult to live in a place where she had to find or make substitutes for everything she needed.

Susan shook her head.

“That’s part of it, but I’m human. Shouldn’t humans live among humans? Even with whatever dangers and hardships that may bring. I’m sorry to Elaga, but I feel that the Forest of Roots is not where I should live. Even though I’m living here now.”

Susan added in a deflated tone.

“Maybe it’s different for Helmut since you grew up in the Forest of Roots.”

Helmut was about to agree, but he closed his mouth.

The air of the Forest of Roots was familiar. The place where he had grown up for over ten years. The Seed of Darkness within him would feel at home in the Forest of Roots, filled with demonic energy.

Yet humans among humans… Why did those words dig so deep into his heart?

It was those very humans who had left him with wounds no beast could ever inflict.

‘I have no reason to leave the Forest of Roots. No, really… do I not?’

He suddenly suspected that maybe he had just been running away, buried in despair and fear.

A certain memory was instantly brought to mind.

Darien. His words were always deeply engraved in Helmut.

Darien always spoke negatively of humans.

But looking back, Darien never told Helmut that he shouldn’t leave the Forest of Roots because humans were like that. He only said not to lose himself.

‘But I did lose myself.’

If Elaga hadn’t stopped him, Helmut would have gone berserk and died.

Either consumed by the Seed of Darkness, or killed by the ruler of another domain.

After a moment, Helmut blurted out.

“…I don’t know.”

“What?”

Susan looked at him with wide eyes. Helmut answered her concisely.

“I’ll talk to Elaga.”

Somehow, Sarah had already disappeared somewhere.



H.F.C Chapter 271 (Part 2):

[What! Why are you here again? I said I won’t help!]

Elaga, who was sprawled out in the cave grooming its fur, immediately got irritated as soon as it saw Helmut. Helmut asked straightforwardly.

“You just don’t want to let them go, right? You like them more than me.”

Elaga often grumbled that Helmut had no charm or cuteness. It probably preferred the more gentle pet humans.

Helmut stared intently at Elaga, then said as if doing it a favor.

“If you want, I can brush your fur.”

Having attended Greta Academy, he had learned about the norms of parent-child relationships.

Elaga was like a foster parent to Helmut. Since it wasn’t human, he couldn’t do much else for it, but he thought he could at least brush its fur.

Elaga gave him a suspicious look.

[Why are you suddenly concerned about them? I thought you said you didn’t want to mate with either of them.]

Helmut answered calmly.

“I feel indebted.”

Although Elaga had ordered it, Susan had taken good care of Helmut for the past 4 years. Even if there wasn’t much to do in the Forest of Roots, preparing meals every day was no easy task.

Not only that, she made his bed and sewed new clothes for him. Susan took care of Helmut with all her heart.

‘She said I reminded her of her brother who was a knight.’

It also seemed she felt sympathy seeing Helmut’s despairing state at first. Not just Susan, but Sarah had been a great help to Helmut too.

Her chattering voice always filled his ears, preventing him from thinking of other things.

Sarah was an exceptionally lively presence in this Forest of Roots.

Elaga blurted out.

[I don’t like your hands. They look hard and rough. You’ll probably end up pulling out my precious fur while brushing.]

That was an unfair assessment. Helmut, taking it as dismissal, raised an eyebrow.

“I’m a swordsman. I’m good with my hands. Why don’t you give me a chance?”

His tone was resolute, as if he would prove his abilities. Elaga immediately frowned deeply.

[The thought of you brushing my fur makes me sick. Forget it!]

It was ironic, considering Elaga had often demanded affection from him. Helmut asked after a brief pause.

“Do you just dislike the idea? No other reason?”

[Like I said. You came back in that state, and they’re weaker than you.]

“Even if there are dangers, they want to leave. Just as I did in the past.”

Helmut posed a question.

“And humans need to live among humans. Isn’t that why you let me go?”

[So you’re saying you want to leave again?]

“…I can no longer be called human. But they’re different.”

Elaga stared blankly at Helmut.

[Since you had the Seed of Darkness, you must have been in excruciating pain when passing through the sacred barrier. You risked your life to leave, and look what happened. Don’t you regret it?]

That question was surprisingly close to the essence. Something seemed to spark inside him. Like light shining through clouds.

After a moment, Helmut gave his answer.

“I don’t regret it.”

A clearer answer than ever.

Although despair found him in the end, everything he experienced before that was still alive and breathing within Helmut.

It still was.

Elaga, who had been staring at Helmut, soon nodded. As if his answer had convinced it.

[Well, in that case, I’ll think about it. Like I said, I’ll *think* about it! That doesn’t mean I’m going to help!]

Helmut knew that those words from Elaga ultimately meant agreement. That leopard always spoke that way.

*

Alea and her group of four were caught in an unexpected ordeal.

It wasn’t the kind of ordeal they had expected when first entering the Forest of Roots.

Hadn’t they come prepared to fight beasts and overcome life-and-death situations in a state of tension?

At least for now, they weren’t in danger. But they were in danger in another sense. In terms of mental health and blood pressure.

[Ah, my legs are stiff? Let’s rest a bit before going on.]

Igrelle was a bird. A colorful bird that constantly stretched out the schedule and did as it pleased.

It was incomprehensible that a bird would insist on walking, but Igrelle frequently showed signs of fatigue, using the excuse that it usually flies.

Despite the demonic energy filling its body, which should have prevented any fatigue.

[I need to take a nap. You all should rest too. Fragile humans shouldn’t overexert yourselves.]

As if doing them a favor, not only irritated them but also,

[That’s it for today. Hurry and groom my feathers. I think my feathers have lost their shine from walking too long. Tsk tsk. This is why I shouldn’t stay on the ground for too long. I feel like I’ve become a lowly land beast.]

It treated the humans traveling with it like servants.

Asuka, the least patient, mentally hurled all sorts of curses.

‘This damn bird bastard. Is it joking? I ought to wring its neck!’

But Igrelle’s neck was thick, and surrounded by demonic energy, it didn’t seem like Asuka’s sword could cut it.

Alea coolly assessed the current situation.

“Our progress is slow, but at least it’s not dangerous. We hardly need to use magic either.”

As long as they couldn’t get rid of Igrelle, they had to accept the slight trials it gave them.

Even if they couldn’t accept it gladly.

Sian pointed out.

“But at this rate, it will take months to reach the central region.”

“Yes, then we need to find a solution.”

A gleam flashed across Alea’s purple eyes.



H.F.C Chapter 272 (Part 1):

“Lord Igrelle.”

[What is it, silver-haired human?]

Igrelle looked down at Alea arrogantly while sitting lazily on the ground.

Its freshly preened feathers annoyingly reflected the light.

After grooming it so often, all four of them had become experts at feather maintenance. They were practically Igrelle’s personal attendants now.

Charlotte and Sian’s expressions weren’t pleased, but Asuka’s face was full of discontent.

“At this rate, we don’t know when we’ll reach the Central Region.”

[So what? That Helmut fellow won’t die in the meantime, will he? Think of it as a leisurely journey.]

Its tone was so irritating that Alea wanted to slap it, despite being the one delaying the schedule, it spoke with such arrogance.

Alea spoke again with a cold expression.

“I have a proposal to make.”

[A proposal? Very well, let’s hear it.]

“Lord Igrelle, ruler of the skies of the Forest of Roots, you’re traveling with us in this inconvenient way because we can’t keep up with your speed, correct?”

[That’s right. As I said, carrying humans on my back is out of the question. And let me be clear, hanging from my claws is also not allowed. I, the great Igrelle, cannot allow myself to be used as a mount by humans.]

Igrelle said arrogantly.

But that wasn’t Alea’s intention. She calmly asked:

“Then if we could match Lord Igrelle’s speed, would I be correct in understanding that you wouldn’t travel at such a slow pace?”

[…Well, I suppose so. But how?]

Igrelle looked at Alea with suspicious eyes.

‘How could mere humans keep up with my speed?’

“There is a way for us to match Lord Igrelle’s speed. We can fly together.”

It wasn’t flight magic. // That would consume too much magical power, and there were only two mages anyway.

Alea had an ace up her sleeve.

However, she was reluctant to reveal this method in front of Igrelle, who was not quite an ally even if it wasn’t an enemy.

She had been hesitating all along, but even the cool-headed Alea felt impatient now that they were inside the Forest of Roots.

Helmut was somewhere in the center, and she didn’t want to delay.

‘If we hadn’t met Igrelle, this method wouldn’t have been usable anyway.’

Flying through the skies of the Forest of Roots meant being exposed to the sight of countless demonic beasts.

Flying demonic beasts weren’t just Igrelle, so the attack range of demonic beasts probably wouldn’t be limited to the ground.

But no demonic beast would dare attack them if they were with Igrelle, so they could fly safely.

[How do you intend to fly? Magic?]

Igrelle didn’t ask why she hadn’t brought this up earlier. It had realized that Alea had been keeping something in reserve.

Alea silently spread her hand towards the empty air.

The dense demonic energy in the Forest of Roots interferes with the manifestation of magic.

Even great mages have difficulty freely using magic here, and her abilities hadn’t reached that level yet.

So it required more magical power and concentration than usual.

However, without fail, pure white magical power bloomed from Alea’s hand and shone brightly.

Zing!

A round circle spread out in the air.

Starting from a tiny point, it rapidly expanded into a huge entrance.

Alea softly chanted a spell.

“Gate of Light.”

She summoned a sub-space corresponding to part of the dungeon.

‘As expected, there are restrictions on interfacing with sub-spaces in the Forest of Roots. I can’t fully open the dungeon, but I can at least take something out from inside.’

Dungeons and similar sub-spaces that constitute entire worlds can basically only be opened in stable environments. Even that itself is high-level magic.

In a place filled with oppressive demonic energy like the Forest of Roots, entering a dungeon is impossible even for great mages.

Igrelle watched the scene unfolding before its eyes with curious interest.

Even for the ruler of the Southern Region who had lived for countless ages, it was its first time seeing proper magic.

[So this is magic? Opening space! You’re quite a skilled mage!]

And then a huge object leaped out of that entrance filled with white light.

Thud!

Everyone’s gazes turned towards it.

The object that fell to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust, was enormous – about half the size of Igrelle’s body.

The object, which had a metallic golden hue, looked like a boulder. A huge boulder densely engraved with magic symbols.

However, there were long cracks all over it, suggesting it could be separated into pieces.

As Alea closed the sub-space, a bead of sweat formed between her brows.

She had consumed a large amount of magical power in an instant. She reached into her pocket and gripped a magic stone.

The magic stone, rapidly drained of power, soon crumbled into an ordinary pebble in her hand.

At that moment, Sian muttered:

“Is it a golem?”

Asuka spoke in a doubtful voice.

“It just looks like a rock to me. How is that a golem?”

Sian spoke with certainty.

“Those magic symbols, it’s definitely a golem. Come to think of it, Archmage Lampione was deeply versed in golems. But I’ve never seen a golem in this form before. Golems are usually made in specific shapes. But this one has no form. Which means, could it be…”

Instead of explaining, Alea pointed towards Igrelle and opened her mouth.

“Mimic.”



H.F.C Chapter 272 (Part 2):

Grrrr.

As soon as the engraved master’s command was given, the boulder began to move.

The cracked parts quickly opened up, separated, and recombined. Soon it took on a new form.

The target of mimicry was clear.

Igrelle.

Kiiiing!

The body split in two, smoothly stretching out in the air to form wings.

A relatively small torso formed in the center, with a head and sharp beak forming above it. Below extended long legs and talons.

Soon, standing there was a huge bird with a metallic golden hue.

A bird-shaped golem slightly smaller than Igrelle.

Although it didn’t have the intricate detail of real feathers, the flapping wings showed it was capable of flight.

Suddenly, a memory flashed through her mind. Alea muttered with a clouded expression.

“The shape-shifting golem, To think I went through all that to get this…”

Following Heike’s advice, Alea explored deep into the dungeon and discovered this golem hidden by Lampione.

Probably the only one of its kind in the world, a culmination of powerful magic.

Alea cut off contact with Helmut and began breaking through the layers of barriers Lampione had set up to secure the golem.

She thought the shape-shifting golem would be a great help if they ever had to fight against the Temple.

In the end, that choice turned out to be a mistake. It took longer than Alea expected to break through the barriers and gain control of the golem.

And while she was completely absorbed in that task with communication cut off, Helmut was betrayed and driven out to this Forest of Roots.

However, Alea did manage to get her hands on this golem.

Igrelle, who had been watching the golem’s transformation with shining eyes, asked curiously:

[That thing can fly? Isn’t metal heavy?]

“When transformed for flight, lightweight magic and wind magic are activated. It’s designed to support the implemented form by magic.”

“Wow, why didn’t you tell us you had something like this!”

As Sian exclaimed in admiration, Asuka shook his head.

“I told you, she doesn’t think of us as friends. Look how unfriendly she’s been all this time. It’s like she’s just saying ‘Shut up and follow me.'”

“I brought it out because it’s necessary, not as a spectacle.”

Alea cut him off and immediately turned to Igrelle.

“Lord Igrelle, please head towards the Central Region. We’ll follow right behind you.”

[Do you really think that thing can keep up with me?]

“Yes.”

Igrelle was momentarily speechless at Alea’s crisp answer. But it soon made a threat.

[Then try to keep up. But if you fall behind, I’ll just go back to walking!]

Igrelle slowly began to flap its wings. The wind carrying demonic energy from the giant bird struck the four humans.

Its body gradually rose into the air.

Igrelle had planned to head slowly towards the Central Region while leisurely receiving feather grooming.

It had nothing but time. It had decided to make good use of these humans.

But the problem was that it was getting antsy after not being able to fly for several days.

It is a bird.

A bird’s instinct is to fly through the sky.

Igrelle wanted to fly through the skies of the Forest of Roots, showing off its neatly groomed feathers to the other demonic beasts.

‘They probably won’t be able to keep up with my speed anyway, so I’ll pretend to go together at first, then fly quickly and lose them. Then I can go back and tell them they’re too slow, and we’ll walk again.’

As Igrelle rose into the sky, Alea gestured with her hand.

“Get on its back. We’ll follow right away.”

As the four quickly climbed onto the golem’s back, four saddles formed in a row on top of the bird.

“Wow, what’s this? This is amazing!”

Sian clicked his tongue. Even to a mage’s eyes, this was no ordinary golem.

Alea sat in the front and fastened the metal strap around her waist.

“Hurry and sit down.”

Charlotte, Asuka, and Sian sat down in order and fastened the metal straps around their waists.

They all nervously fiddled with their waistbands. Sitting on a bird and flying was something none of them had experienced before.

By the time they had all finished preparing, Igrelle had already risen completely into the sky and was looking down at them as if urging them on. Its huge shadow covered them.

“Let’s go.”

As Alea gave the command, the golem folded its wings.

Groooo, Kwang!

Soon the golem’s legs kicked off the ground, and it shot up towards the sky like an arrow.

Whoosh!

When it reached an altitude close to Igrelle, both wings spread out in a parabolic arc.

The golem stopped in midair.

However, that recoil shook the riders’ entire bodies.

“Aaaagh!”

As their bodies were flung back and the metal straps were pulled taut, Asuka screamed.

No matter how brave a swordsman he was, that only applied on the ground, not in the sky.

The ground was now dizzyingly far below. It was a height that instinctively induced fear. None of them had ever flown this high before.

With the wind whipping around them and even shaking their bodies, they felt dizzy.

“Urgh!”

Sian also groaned while summoning a wind spirit.

Charlotte was silent, her face pale. She seemed to be overwhelmed by her acrophobia.

Sian protested:

“What kind of takeoff was that with no warning! Shouldn’t we have flapped our wings and slowly risen up?”

“This is a golem, not a real bird. The method might be a bit different. But it will be faster. Much faster than walking.”

Alea replied irritatingly calmly.

In truth, it was her first time testing the golem in flight mode.

‘It should be fine. I’ve tested its stability.’

She nonchalantly thought that with two mages, they wouldn’t die even if they fell.

Igrelle tilted its head as it looked at the golem that had quickly flown up to join it.

[Quite fast, aren’t you? Alright then, shall we fly?]

With a competitive spirit rising, Igrelle flapped its wings vigorously.

Even if it was receiving magical assistance, Igrelle was certain that a mere golem wouldn’t be able to keep up with its speed.

Igrelle was confident.

‘Let’s see if you can keep up.’

Igrelle planned to fly at full speed from the start!



H.F.C Chapter 273 (Part 1): Reunion
				This is a relatively recent event in the long history of the Forest of Roots.

About 6 years ago, Elaga, the ruler of the Central Region, eliminated Naho, the ruler of the Eastern Region, and devoured its core.

The core from the two-headed snake was filled with pitch-black and evil energy, and even madness could be felt as Naho was half-insane when it died.

What it contained was Naho’s will. If Elaga failed to digest it after swallowing it, it was powerful enough to drive all the beasts in the forest into a frenzy.

At that time, Elaga made a judgment.

‘If another creature swallows this, a beast as formidable as Naho would appear.’

A demonic beast as strong and as evil as Naho!

Demonic energy is a pure force close to instinct in itself. Although that purity tends to lean towards evil, Naho was an exceptionally wicked beast even in the Forest of Roots.

With Helmut gone, Elaga had no need to protect anyone.

Even if another creature like Naho appeared, it wouldn’t be a problem. Because Elaga was strong!

‘Still, I don’t want such a creature to appear again.’

It was unsettling, but since Elaga had already eliminated Naho, it decided to handle it properly. That was Elaga’s resolution.

However, contrary to its resolution, Elaga wasn’t very thorough.

When Elaga left after absorbing Naho’s core, Naho’s body was left behind.

The remnants of blood from Naho’s body and the demonic energy from the core merged and formed a lump.

A fragment of that power remained faintly in that place.

That which contained Naho’s evil power was like a seed of darkness. A very small seed of darkness.

But it had enough self-awareness to influence will.

Like a seed of darkness, it had a will that could dominate someone.

It was hard to consider this as Elaga’s mistake. Because the death of a regional ruler was unprecedented.

Soon, a small, perceptive monster was drawn to that place where Elaga had left. To gain even a little remaining demonic energy and become stronger.

It was a white rabbit, close to the bottom of the food chain in the Forest of Roots.

The white rabbit, which had been sniffing around, swallowed the fragment of Naho that was glimmering with a black light, as if it was calling to it.

And the rabbit’s feeble self-awareness was instantly devoured by the fragment.

Yes, it was Naho’s soul. Although not a complete soul. A broken, shattered, and maddened soul. But burning with a single-minded will.

‘Elaga, Elaga, Elaga!’

What dominated it was resentment and anger towards Elaga, who had killed it.

But charging at Elaga in a white rabbit’s body would be a shortcut to death.

So it waited. It didn’t need to wait long, as Elaga began to care for two human females.

‘Weakness… its weakness!’

The white rabbit rejoiced. Humans are fragile, and it could easily kill them with its current body.

But approaching them was the problem. They were in Elaga’s territory.

Because the Forest of Roots was so dangerous, Elaga kept the two of them close and cared for them.

If it approached with the intention of targeting them, it might become Elaga’s meal, again.

‘Right, not yet. Elaga needs to spend more time with those humans. Only then will it be even more painful when it loses them!’

The white rabbit decided to become stronger. By absorbing the demonic energy of the Forest of Roots and devouring other beasts, it gradually grew stronger.

Because it was imbued with a fragment of Naho, who had been a regional ruler, it was easy for it to become stronger.

Stronger and stronger, smarter and smarter.

As its strength grew, the white rabbit, now more aware of its malevolent nature, eventually attained intelligence equal to that of a human.

When Helmut returned to the Forest of Roots, the shock of encountering him only heightened the rabbit’s malice.

The white rabbit was consumed with thoughts of revenge.

‘Human, the human who tore my eyes!’

This was an opportunity for it.

That human who had left the Forest of Roots and was out of reach had returned.

However, Helmut was stronger than the white rabbit. Far too strong to be challenged with its current body. It was frustrating and infuriating.

But Helmut created an opportunity.

It was about three years after Sarah began learning swordsmanship.

As she started to act separately from her mother Susan, she gradually moved out of Elaga’s sight. This was because she wandered around Elaga’s territory too much, supposedly for training.

Elaga couldn’t protect both Susan and Sarah, so as time passed, it chose to protect Susan rather than Sarah, who had become strong enough to flee from or resist beasts.

Although she spent time with Helmut as well, he didn’t follow her around to take care of her. During the times she wandered for physical training, she was alone.

The white rabbit cautiously approached her.

Seeing its appearance, Sarah opened her eyes wide and pointed.

“Oh? There’s a white rabbit here. You must be a demonic beast too, right? You’re really pretty!”

Fortunately, the white rabbit’s appearance was quite convincing. A large rabbit with pure white fur and red eyes.

It was hard to imagine that it harbored a fragment of the vicious Naho, and its fur color being very similar to Elaga’s made it seem even more familiar.

Moreover, rabbits are herbivores. No sharp claws or teeth.

But the wariness didn’t disappear from Sarah’s face.

No matter how plausible its appearance, a beast is a beast.

The weaker and smaller the monster, the more it follows its instincts. The instinct to devour humans!

Elaga’s scent on Sarah was suppressing that instinct, but for most demonic beasts, humans are just prey.

Then the white rabbit abruptly spoke.

[Hello, human. I no eat human. Safe. Very.]

Naho likes young humans.

The moment it first saw her, it salivated, but the white rabbit hid its appetite with clumsy speech.

Sarah was startled.

“Oh, rabbit? Can you talk?”

[Talk. I, human, first see.]

“I’ve never seen a talking beast other than Lord Elaga either!”

[I, bit smart. I, weak but smart rabbit.]

Sarah, who had no one to talk to except the extremely taciturn Helmut, her mother, and Elaga, instantly felt a sense of familiarity with this talking white rabbit.

Although it was three times her size, it was adorably small compared to Elaga.



H.F.C Chapter 273 (Part 2): Reunion
				[To Elaga, about me. Don’t tell. If tell, I die.]

“Elaga? Right, right. Lord Elaga does have quite a personality. It really dislikes other beasts.”

Sarah laughed brightly.

“Oh right, my name is Sarah. Call me Sarah. What’s your name?”

[Name, you. Whatever you want call. I name, no have.]

Usually, beasts name themselves. As they develop self-awareness and awaken to their demonic nature, beasts somehow come to know their names as if realizing them.

That name holds the only meaning that defines that beast.

But the white rabbit wasn’t strong enough to have a name. It just had exceptionally high intelligence due to Naho’s fragment residing in it.

After pondering for a while, Sarah finally spoke.

“Name? Since you’re cute, I’ll call you Pomi. It’s the name of a dog we used to keep at home long ago.”

‘This, human! How dare you treat me like a pet!’

It was a name that greatly displeased it. But the white rabbit had no choice as it needed to make a good impression on her.

[Po…mi. Pomi, like.]

“Okay, I have to go train now, so let’s meet again! You live around here, right?”

[Here, grass tasty. Elaga. If not come.]

Weak beasts instinctively sense the presence of strong beasts. Elaga was not present in this area.

“Alright, Pomi. Eat lots of grass!”

Even while waving with a bright face, Sarah didn’t close the distance with the rabbit until the end. She was feeling cautious.

The white rabbit, now named Pomi, waited. Until it became close enough with Sarah.

If Elaga looked closely at the white rabbit, it could have noticed. That Naho’s fragment resided in it.

Elaga, who had digested even Naho’s core, was an opponent far beyond the white rabbit’s ability to handle.

The white rabbit narrowed the distance each time it met Sarah, and by about the fifth meeting, Sarah was comfortably stroking Pomi’s fur.

“You’re really different from other beasts. How can you be so docile?”

[Pomi, docile. I bit, different. Special.]

The white rabbit, with the human girl right beside it, fell into deep thought.

It succeeded in getting close, but this girl was different from before. Her growth rate was astonishing.

The human girl had become strong enough that she couldn’t be killed in an instant.

‘So that guy called Helmut taught her the sword huh.’

In Naho’s vague memory, it recalled how rapidly Helmut had become stronger.

Underestimating him based on his previous appearance had been its downfall.

‘To kill her, I first need to lure her out of Elaga’s territory.’

Only then could it fight and kill her. If it can’t kill her instantly and a fight breaks out, Elaga will sense the disturbance and rush here, and then it’s a dead beast.

‘I don’t want to die again.’

The white rabbit wasn’t Naho, but it was also Naho.

It decided to be as cautious as it had been diligent so far.

After all, the Forest of Roots is the domain of beasts. Without any interference, it should be able to kill one human.

Even for adults, distinguishing between good and evil is difficult. Sarah quickly grew fond of the kind and gentle white rabbit.

The white rabbit didn’t rashly try to lure her to a distant place. Sarah’s days were regular. She had no motive to leave Elaga’s territory. Not yet.

And today. Sarah confided her troubles to the white rabbit. That Elaga was opposing her leaving the Forest of Roots.

And the humans Elaga refused to save.

“What if those people die? There might be a child my age. I was really young when I entered the Forest of Roots.”

[Forest of Roots, human. Entered long time. Can’t help.]

The white rabbit had also sensed that new humans had entered the Forest of Roots.

Naho had been particularly sensitive to sensing such things, so it had secured and brought such humans before anyone else.

‘I haven’t eaten human flesh for a long time.’

It had to starve with a fresh young girl right beside it. Thinking of them made its mouth water.

Even though other humans had entered, it wanted to catch and eat them, but they were a bit far.

Moreover, it was Igrelle’s territory. Igrelle particularly likes rabbit beasts. Of course, as prey.

Hearing this, Sarah asked.

“Oh right, Pomi. You’re a beast too. Do you know where the humans entered?”

[South, Igrelle’s territory. Different feeling than usual. But entered. Certainly. There.]

“The south?”

Sarah’s eyes widened. The sacred barrier in the south, closest to the human world. Does that mean humans appeared there?

Her heart pounded.

‘If no one saves them, I will!’

“You, do you know where that is?”

Sarah asked with determined eyes.

Sarah had now become stronger and quite a capable swordswoman. Strong enough to beat most beasts. This gave her confidence.

[Know, but. Going? Elaga…]

“Even if Elaga opposes, there’s nothing I can do. And besides, you’re here too.”

Seeing Sarah’s brightly smiling face made it feel strange, but the white rabbit shook off that feeling. Because beasts shouldn’t feel such things.

Sarah exclaimed energetically.

“Let’s go!”

And so, the opportunity the white rabbit had been waiting for arrived.



H.F.C Chapter 274 (Part 1):

It was Susan who noticed that Sarah was missing.

Since it was normal for Sarah to train late into the night, Susan had fallen asleep waiting for her without much concern.

But Sarah hadn’t returned by morning. Only then did Susan realize the seriousness of the situation.

“I thought she was just out getting some air because she was upset, but where on earth did she go?”

Susan paced back and forth.

This was the dangerous Forest of Roots.

Susan hadn’t forgotten that fact, but 12-year-old Sarah was different.

Sarah, whose skills had recently improved significantly, was full of confidence.

Having lived safely under Elaga’s protection for half her life, it was understandable that her sense of caution had dulled.

Helmut extended his senses to survey the surroundings.

“She doesn’t seem to be in the vicinity.”

“And I don’t know where Elaga went either…”

Elaga hadn’t appeared since its conversation with Helmut, perhaps needing time to organize its thoughts.

That’s why Susan had come to ask Helmut for help.

“She wouldn’t have gotten hurt and collapsed somewhere, would she?”

“I’ll go look for her.”

Helmut spent the entire day searching for Sarah at high speed throughout Elaga’s territory.

But Sarah’s whereabouts could not be found even after looking carefully.

Only then did Helmut also become alarmed.

‘Could it be, she’s not in the territory?’

Helmut was unable to track Sarah’s missing whereabouts.

There were very few traces of Sarah, and they were already scattered throughout Elaga’s territory.

Even if he found traces, it was difficult to distinguish whether they were from yesterday.

‘I hope she wasn’t kidnapped by a beast.’

The Forest of Roots.

Even though it was Elaga’s territory, some bold beast might have attempted something.

Human flesh was the most favored delicacy for demonic beasts. If a strong one targeted her, Sera wouldn’t have been able to resist.

If so, Sarah was already dead.

‘But if something that strong entered the territory, could Elaga not know about it?’

Beasts that can hide their demonic energy are rare.

Revealing one’s demonic energy to make others feel one’s strength is the way of survival in The Forest of Roots.

Elaga appeared, sauntering over just as Helmut finished searching and returned to Susan.

[Hey, I’ve been thinking… Huh? Where’s Sarah?]

Looking at the two of them, the atmosphere was clearly not good.

Helmut replied:

“She’s gone.”

Susan asked Elaga with an urgent expression:

“Can’t you sense Sarah’s presence within the territory?”

[She’s not around here. But if there had been a fight in my territory, I would have noticed.]

At that moment, something suddenly occurred to Susan. She muttered as if frozen:

“Those people.”

[Who? The humans?]

“The people who entered The Forest of Roots. Sarah said we must go and save them, remember? Could she have gone there?”

It was an insightful motherly deduction.

Elaga replied indifferently:

[How would Sarah know where they are in this vast Forest of Roots?]

“But you know, don’t you, Elaga?”

[Yes, near the southern sacred barrier.]

“Then could you please search the southern part of your territory?”

Susan was indeed sharp.

Elaga found in the southern part of its territory what Helmut couldn’t find.

It was Sarah’s trace. And next to it, the faint trail of a beast.

Only then did Elaga become serious.

[There are no signs of resistance. They moved together. What was this girl thinking, following a beast? Both Susan and I told her never to trust beasts and never to leave the territory!]

Helmut calmly pointed out:

“She’s only 12, still young. Without the Seed of Darkness, she’s just a child. She could be easily deceived.”

Helmut knew about the general developmental process of humans.

Unlike Helmut, who was calm and cautious, mature early due to having the Seed of Darkness, Sarah had a lively and impulsive personality.

She had been subdued by the ominous atmosphere upon entering The Forest of Roots, but her personality came back to life after learning swordsmanship.

She was also overflowing with confidence due to being praised for her recent improvements.

But how could she think she could go rescue other humans in this Forest of Roots?

‘It’s true that she’s had some success hunting beasts and has decent skills, but she’s still far from ready. Did I praise her too much?’

Objectively speaking, Sarah wasn’t skilled enough to roam freely in The Forest of Roots.

But unlike Darien, Helmut wanted to teach her, so he occasionally said things like “well done” to Sarah, in line with the level of ordinary humans.

Sarah firmly believed Helmut’s words.

Moreover, one fact she was overlooking was that Elaga’s scent was on her body.

Few beasts near the Central Region could properly fight a human with Elaga’s scent.

She had caught beasts stronger than her level. So her arrogance was somewhat justified.

‘I hope Elaga’s scent keeps Sarah safe.’

After swallowing Naho’s core, Elaga’s scent had become even stronger. All nearby beasts trembled at Elaga’s presence.

‘But what kind of beast could it be?’

Sarah was also a child who grew up in the Forest of Roots. She wasn’t the type to lack caution, so how did a beast manage to deceive her? It must be a very intelligent one.

‘I have a bad feeling about this.’

“Let’s go, Elaga. We know where they’re headed, so we need to find her.”

I hope we’re not too late.

Feeling a sense of crisis for the first time in a while, Helmut naturally climbed onto Elaga’s back.

Feeling the same, Elaga just frowned a little without resisting.



H.F.C Chapter 274 (Part 2):

The white rabbit was sprinting through the Forest of Roots at high speed. After running for hours, Sarah tugged on the white rabbit’s ears and shouted:

“Stop! I’m tired. Let’s rest for a bit!”

The white rabbit obediently stopped.

‘We’ve come quite a distance. Even Elaga would have a hard time catching up now.’

Sarah, who had dismounted onto the ground, exclaimed in admiration as she brushed off the white fur stuck to her body:

“Wow, amazing. You’re really good at running.”

[I, good at, running. Fast rabbit.]

And something Sarah didn’t know was that it was quite strong too.

It could have been targeted by other demonic beasts since it was suppressing its demonic energy unlike typical demonic beasts, but the white rabbit had fast legs. Extremely fast.

The white rabbit could run at a speed just slightly slower than Elaga’s.

‘I can’t let others snatch away my prey.’

Getting her out of Elaga’s territory was one thing, but it would be troublesome if some other beast benefited.

[Rest, little. If Elaga, follows, it’s over. Humans, might be, dying. Still, long way, to go.]

“Right, we need to hurry.”

Sarah plopped down on the ground, already looking a bit tired.

It’s fortunate that she was trained as a swordswoman, because rabbits are not very comfortable to ride.

They’re fast, but directly taking the impact of the rabbit’s leaps made her feel nauseous.

“But when we meet those people, how do we check if they’re good people worth saving?”

[If good, can tell. Like me.]

The white rabbit shamelessly lied.

But Sarah nodded with a bright smile.

“Right, that’s true! We’ll be able to tell when we see them. I have good judgment!”

‘Yeah right, I’m not so sure about that.’

The white rabbit didn’t bother to point that out.

Sarah was lost in other thoughts.

“Then how do we safely bring them back? You can’t carry them all. Should we make a cart?”

‘This human plans to use me to the fullest, huh?’

Not only riding on its back, but treating it like a draft animal. It was humiliating in many ways.

[Rabbit, not cart-pulling animal. Can’t pull, cart.]

“Then we’ll have to walk back, but do you know how to fight? Lord Elaga has teeth and claws, but you’re a rabbit. Your teeth looked blunt, how do you fight? Body slam?”

Watching Sarah laugh heartily, the white rabbit felt offended.

It’s true that carnivores have an advantage over herbivores even among demonic beasts, but of all things, a rabbit.

Thanks to that, it was able to deceive Sarah, but it was also being disrespected.

[Don’t, underestimate me. I can, fight.]

Especially the young girl in front of it – it would take a bit of a scuffle, but it could knock her out with a body slam and eat her.

But the white rabbit decided to be cautious.

‘Not yet. Not yet. To eat her and run away, we need to get further from Elaga’s territory. If Elaga finds out that the girl it cherished is dead, it’ll surely come after me.’

“Okay, I’m all rested. Let’s hurry. We can’t be late.”

Sarah got up, dusting off her bottom with a smiling face.

It could attack here without going through troublesome processes, but…

The white rabbit docilely let Sarah climb onto its back.

It wasn’t time yet.

*

“Ugh, I feel like I’ve turned into a bird.”

Sian muttered with a pale blue face. Asuka and Charlotte, whose souls seemed to have left their bodies, were silent.

For a day and a half, they had been flying non-stop behind Igrelle’s tail.

Just flying across the sky looking down at the dizzying ground below was enough to drain one’s mental strength.

They tried asking Alea to rest for a bit, but it was no use.

“We need to go as far as we can before Igrelle changes its mind. I’ll cast recovery magic on you. Just hang in there a little longer.”

The golem’s speed was extraordinary.

It seemed to easily draw magic power from the atmosphere of the Forest of Roots, as it had only been supplied with magic through the magic stone once. It was an incredibly efficient golem.

Asuka muttered with a pale face:

“It really is fast.”

They all just hoped to arrive at the Central Region quickly.

And Igrelle.

‘What is that thing? Did they say it’s a golem? How is it keeping up like this?!’

Igrelle’s eyes narrowed. It had never felt so humiliated before.

Igrelle was flying at full speed. Igrelle is a bird. And the fastest flying creature in this forest.

No other flying creature in the Forest of Roots could match Igrelle’s speed.

But that golem was different.

Even with magical support, the golem was keeping up right behind Igrelle without falling behind at all. Despite carrying four humans on its back!

Is a golem’s structure actually better than a real bird’s?

‘No, this is… because of the spirit. The wind spirit is eliminating air resistance.’

Igrelle tried to rationalize.

But using demonic energy to fly desperately would hurt its pride.

Igrelle’s useless pride demanded that it outpace its opponent through pure wing speed alone.

Igrelle thought it would become a long-distance race, but even after a day, the golem showed no signs of fatigue and kept up with it.

‘It’s too fast. At this rate, we’ll arrive at the Central Region in no time.’

But for some reason, Igrelle couldn’t stop.

It seemed like it had already given up on preening its feathers.

‘Huh? But.’

At that moment, something entered Igrelle’s field of vision.



H.F.C Chapter 275 (Part 1):

‘That’s…!’

Igrelle’s pupils dilated greatly. His exceptional eyesight had detected something white and plump down in the forest below.

A rabbit with an adorable appearance that Igrelle would just love to sink its beak into. But the tiny thing clinging to it escaped Igrelle’s whirling eyes.

‘A rabbit!’

Igrelle loves rabbits. Tremendously so.

At that moment, the presence of the golem following it disappeared from Igrelle’s mind.

Igrelle was, in this instant, acting purely on instinct.

Giiiiiing!

The enormous bird beast plummeted down with a deafening roar!

Before Igrelle could pounce, a shadow engulfed them first. Sarah and the white rabbit, whom she had named Pomi!

“Huh? It suddenly got dark!”

[This is…]

The white rabbit sensed the danger. It was the rabbit’s instinct, not Naho’s.

Thud! Crack!

The white rabbit dodged to the side as the massive talons swept violently through the space it had occupied.

Wherever Igrelle’s talons tore, the trees collapsed and the forest was ripped apart.

Whoosh!

The ensuing gusts of wind followed.

Sarah could barely escape being blown away, clinging desperately to the white rabbit’s ear.

Soon, she muttered in a daze,

“A bird, that’s a bird? How can a bird be that big!”

The white rabbit immediately recognized the true identity of the ‘bird’.

‘Why is Igrelle here! This is close to the Central Territory.’

It was a disaster.

Igrelle and Naho were not on good terms at all. It’s difficult for a bird and a snake to get along. Since they are natural enemies

If Igrelle were to detect the presence of Naho within the white rabbit, then…

The white rabbit wavered for a moment.

‘Should I throw this girl away and run?’

But even if Igrelle didn’t realize that fact, it had no intention of giving up on the white rabbit.

Having missed his target and ravaged the surroundings, Igrelle flapped its wings and circled back towards the white rabbit.

[Quite agile, eh? Good. Let’s see if you can evade me again… Hm?]

Igrelle blinked.

A human girl had suddenly leaped in front of the white rabbit, sword drawn and pointed in its direction.

In Igrelle’s eyes, the sword in her hand glinted sharply, like a toothpick.

And Sarah’s eyes were shining with valor.

“Pomi, run away while I fight!”

Sarah had recklessly abandoned all fear.

It was she who had brought Pomi here. Sarah was burning with a sense of duty to protect the only friend she had made in the Forest of Roots.

The white rabbit watching this was dumbfounded.

‘What a foolish girl, turning her back on me! And she doesn’t even know who she’s up against?’

Stupidity may breed courage, but this was simply ridiculous.

A weak young human thinking she can counter-attack the ruler of the south, Igrelle.

‘If I leave now, this girl will die. The objective would be achieved. Elaga will also redirect its focus to Igrelle, and the two of them fighting would be even better. But still…’

It felt somewhat unsatisfying, as it intended to kill her itself. That must be the reason. The white rabbit hesitated, unable to leave.

Sarah shouted again.

“Go, hurry!”

‘What is this human doing? Could it be, she’s trying to protect that rabbit? A human protecting a beast?’

Igrelle was momentarily confused. This was a sight rarely seen twice in one’s lifetime.

At that moment, a bird-shaped golem landed next to the distracted Igrelle. And from its back, four humans leapt down.

The silver-haired female mage spoke up.

“Lord Igrelle, didn’t you say you don’t eat humans?”

“The reason you suddenly plummeted… Was it to eat the child?”

A suspicious gaze was fixed on Igrelle. Igrelle felt acutely indignant.

[No, I was trying to catch the rabbit back there. Not the human!]

Sian scratched his cheek and asked,

“Wait, more importantly, why is there a person here?”

“A person? Isn’t that a girl? What’s a young girl doing in a place like this?”

Wide-eyed Sarah pointed at the newcomers.

“Hey, people!”

They were all surprised to encounter people in the Forest of Roots.

‘Ah yes, I came here to rescue them.’

Sarah regained her composure first.

Having grown accustomed to seeing the gigantic Elaga daily, Igrelle, in comparison, didn’t seem that threatening.

Igrelle was just a pretty bird, albeit a large one, compared to Elaga.

“Is everyone alright?”

At her question, the group members looked around at each other.

Asuka opened his mouth in a disgruntled tone.

“I’m more curious about whether you’re alright. What are you, a kid, doing here with a sword?”

Sensing Igrelle’s narrowed eyes, Sian quickly interjected.

“Lord Igrelle.”

Sarah shouted loudly.

“That bird was trying to eat my friend!”

[It’s normal for a stronger beast to eat a weaker one in the Forest of Roots.]

Igrelle’s eyes still held a hungry desire. The desire for a delectable prey in front of it!

[Get out of the way, you’re in the way. I need to catch that white rabbit!]



H.F.C Chapter 275 (Part 2):

Sarah raised her sword again, eyes blazing.

“No way! As long as I’m here, Pomi won’t be eaten!”

Asuka replied indifferently.

“Why are you protecting a beast? Just hand it over.”

Sian also asked curiously.

“What kind of demonic beast name is Pomi? Did you give it that name?”

The conversation was descending into chaos. It was an unclear situation.

Amidst the confusion, Alea quickly organized her thoughts while observing the scene before her.

‘She’s a young girl in the Forest of Roots. She doesn’t seem very strong. Then she must be under someone’s protection. And this is the route to the Central Region. That someone must be the leopard Elaga.’

At that moment, Igrelle noticed the white rabbit cautiously retreating, and became impatient.

[Ugh! Get out of the way, human child! If you block me, I won’t hold back!]

Thump, thump! Igrelle stomped its feet on the ground as it advanced.

Sarah continued to backpedal, but had no intention of moving aside. She raised her sword again, her eyes shining with determination.

Alea asked,

“You there, do you know of a leopard named Elaga?”

Hesitating for a moment, Igrelle’s guarded expression eased slightly.

[Elaga, you say? Are you the human that Elaga raised?]

Seeing the figure of Alea, who had been concealed behind, Sarah’s pupils dilated.

It was a reaction as if she had encountered something surreal. The silver-haired woman in the vivid purple robes was so stunningly beautiful that she hardly seemed human.

Sarah stammered in belated response.

“Y-yes, I live with… Lord Elaga.”

A gleam passed through Alea’s eyes.

“Then, by any chance, is there also a human named Helmut living with you?”

Her voice was level, but the fervent emotions welling up in her heart were palpable.

Alea waited for the girl’s answer.

‘Helmut? How did she know about Helmut all of a sudden?’

Sarah was about to blurt out a yes, but suddenly a rising wariness made her choose her words carefully. She finally thought it through.

‘Helmut was banished to the Forest of Roots after being betrayed in the human world.’

Then these outsiders may not have come with good intentions to find Helmut. If they were hostile to Helmut…

Sarah lied nonchalantly.

“I’ve seen him, but we don’t live together. I don’t know where he is.”

She felt deflated.

Alea suppressed her disappointment and tried to console herself.

‘It couldn’t have been that easy to find him.’

“More importantly, what about you all? What’s going on with that bird? Weren’t you all exiled to the Forest of Roots?”

Sarah tilted her head. But the Alea’s group seemed quite well-prepared and untroubled, as if they had willingly entered this Forest of Roots for some purpose.

‘Could that be… possible?’

Igrelle bristled its feathers, irritated.

[This place isn’t even the Central Region yet, why is Elaga’s pet human wandering around here? How annoying. I almost killed you! So I’m not just sticking my beak in for no reason!]

Seeing Igrelle’s outburst, Sarah finally realized Igrelle’s identity.

“The ruler of the Southern Region… Igrelle?”

[So you’ve finally recognized me. Well, at least you have eyes, young human.]

“This isn’t the Southern Region, though.”

[It’s not the Central Region either. A weak little thing like you shouldn’t be coming to this area!]

“I came to rescue those people.”

Sarah became increasingly confused. Then why was she here?

Those people seemed to have the ability to protect themselves.

But she didn’t understand why Igrelle was with them. Does Igrelle, like Elaga, also protect humans?

[Could that rabbit also be one of Elaga’s subordinates? Does Elaga even have beasts as its retainers? But that rabbit seems a bit off somehow. I feel a strange aura from it.]

Igrelle narrowed its eyes as it eyed the hesitating white rabbit behind Sarah. It was a vague, unsettling sensation.

At that moment, the silent Charlotte stepped forward.

“Um, we’re looking for Helmut and heading to the Central Region. We were close with him, you see. Do you think we could meet Elaga?”

If this child was under Elaga’s protection, it would help to approach Elaga peacefully.

Seeing Charlotte’s face, Sarah suddenly stiffened.

She slowly scanned Charlotte’s features and muttered.

“She looks alike…”

There was a sense of familiarity in Sarah’s voice, as if she had encountered someone resembling a close person.

Allea’s voice turned icy.

“You really don’t know where Helmut is?”

“Well, that’s…”

As Sarah hesitated, the white rabbit behind her suddenly leapt from its spot and dashed off.

‘I can’t let Igrelle recognize me!’

Since Igrelle likely has no intention of antagonizing Elaga, it probably won’t kill Sarah. So the white rabbit can wait for the next opportunity.

The most important thing now is to save its own life.

Fortunately, Igrelle did not pursue the white rabbit. The rabbit let out a sigh of relief and hopped away diligently.
